That's harsh. Yeah same here. I had a girlfriend and she cheated on me thinking it was a game. The worst part is she posted pictures up with her significant other. What am I side line bitch? I dumped her instead and made her feel like shit. It's awful I know.
Many many times. So much so that I've quit dating altogether. Single life has it's advantages, I suppose. :3
Awe you poor man TheLotusEater. You need a faithful woman. ;~; I would probably quit too. So many stitches in my heart from feeling pain. Who would want to hurt such a sweet guy like you?
Yeah I've been cheated on entirely too much -___- people these days can't keep it in their pants.
Umm...does my 19th birthday counts?  So i walked back into living room and well there was my love (now my ex ofc) making out with a girl and a guy at the same time haha -ok i feelt miserable - "Happy birthday to me !" I dont celebrate birthdays since then...o.o And one other time with that same guy ..he told me he needs me dont want to lose me,that he cares blah blah blah (things i dont believe anymore if anyone tells me)..20 mins later HES NAKED and drunk into bathtub WITH 2 NAKED girls....
oommggg i was with a guy for 3 whole fuckin years only to find out that he had been cheating on me LOTS of times, lying and ughh. he broke my heart and then acts like its my fault somehow x3 ahaha like what even??? .
Kassidy poor you, I understand that, like I was with my ex for 3 years to...like breaking up and making up and again and again....like....now i dont even know why i forgave him all that shit he did to me....like....like i was blind....blinded by love...ughh....I could have died for him...but he...well..he...he in the end was the one who killed me...

Lol that's true Alexa. I've honestly had way worse luck with girls than I have with guys.
And I think the lessons they give us are important. It takes heartbreak to stop blindly wearing your heart on your sleeve. and it makes us stronger people.

Loneliness is a better company. You girls are very brave. ;~; It makes me want to beat the crap out of the assholes who hurt you. As for you TheLotusEater, It was just a guess. I'm trying to be nice. xD Make friends not enemies. You look very friendly everyone does to me. Am I to assume you're dick? Nah I highly doubt it although you can prove me wrong.
twice in an entire two year engagement, and yes it took me a bit to fully find out but when I did I broke it off
Cheating = most of my relationships.
Was in a relationship with many girls and they all end with her being unfaithful and somehow making it my fault. Even walking in on her fucking my best friend I've known for years which ended up in a lost love and a lost friend that to this day says it's my fault.
I've been cheated on many times actually. Once I walked in on one of my friends making out with my boyfriend ( ex ). And i couldn't stop crying since we had been together for 2 months. Sometimes I just wonder if something better is being planed for me or I'm not meant to be with anyone.
Yup many tears were had and revenge was always on my mind, but nope I was too pussy to do it
Been in a few relationships, estimate 10, and 8 out of 10 times I was cheated on, but I just got into a relationship recently and she is loyal, so basically it's 8/11.
should be hands up , if you havnt been cheated on..
How about, have any of you ever cheated on someone?
nope. never. i was loyal down to the bloody end. ugh. sometimes i wish i could give that bitch a taste of his own medicine .
go kassidy haha
Nope i am a strange older daft loyal prick
No I dont think it would be fair to give someone the same pain I went through the irony is too much :/

No....I haven't been in a relationship because of these types of insecurities. I just want a nice relationship with a guy that will hold me in his arms till dawn and someone I can be sure won't leave me because of stupid reasons....Someone I can love with my whole heart and care for.
@aunryse thats cause you are decent
I feel like most people have. Not a very fun experience. But you live and learn.
very true indeed
Literally every relationship I've ever been in tbh....
my ex boyfriend cheated on me a few times and never told me, i only found out because he left his facebook messages open last sunday.
I hate that crap. I hate finding out AFTER. Especially if they're the one that dumped you.
I was just in a relationship not so long ago she was nice until she stab my back literally thn left me , she took everything I had even my heart and then she crushed it

Luckily, no. Or rather, I don't think so.BUT! My ex boyfriend already had a girlfriend when I asked him out. We had been together for three years until I found out and broke up with him. It was the hardest time I had in a while. It broke me and prevented me from trusting anybody. I am in a relationship now, but it took me months to actually accept him properly (I've been friends with him for 3 years).
yeah it was a pretty messed up situation .__. and aww thank you
I've never actually been cheated on since i rarely date but sometimes i overthink so much at night i think i drive myself insane and make myself believe they cheat on me,
Actually no, if you find people who love you and who tell you every day that they love you and make sure you know it, then they usually won't do that stuff. Surround yourself with people who don't like hurting people and you usually won't get hurt. That's my best advice.
Like 90% of my exes have cheated on me.
Like every ex ive ever had has cheated on me except one. but i fucked that realationship up big time :( real love is hard to find lol
Gave up trusting because always cheated on and lied to wether relationship is long or short tried dating a friend I cared about accidentally stumbled onto posts of her with her ex fiance turned out was two timed whole time....lesson learnt right? Later on tried dating a friend who drove me to trusting again finally....again stumbled onto posts on her social media as well with pics even with her ex fiance..... I never cheated once and stayed honest but always comes out the same  like my hearts the canvas for liars to make their bruises then failed suicide attempts and more scars teach you that you can always trust yourself failing or not you always have you
I was with this one guy for a while he made me so happy and always made my day but one day he started to act weird and abusive later that week I found out that cheated on me for a month I was heartnroke

We are Nunmoose.

Hellloooooo everyone. These are the words of wisdom from REB.This page explains the various things in the world that annoy the SHIT outa me. God i just LOVE freedom of speech. Keep in mind that these are just my point of views, and may or may not reflect on anyone else. I do swear a lot on this page. so fuck off if your a pussy who cant handle a little god damn bad language. heeeheee. And now to get started:---------------------------------------------------YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When im walking around in a mall and there is this SLOW AS SHIT person walking in front of me!! Goddamnit im trying to get somewhere! So move it or loose it BITCHES!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When there is a group of assholes standing in the middle of a hallway or walkway, and they are just STANDING there and talking and blocking my fucking way!! Get the fuck outa the way or ill bring a friggin sawed-off shotgun to your house and blow your snotty ass head off! YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When people dont watch where THEY ARE FUCKING GOING! Then they plow into me and say "oops, sorry." or "watch it!" NNNYAAAA!!! Next time that happens i will rip out 2 of your damn ribs and shove em into your fuckin eye balls!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---When some rich ass stuck up piece of shit white trash person gets in a car wreck with their brand new car! YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---When some stupid ass kid blows his fucking hand off because he couldnt figure out that a lit fuse means that the firecracker is going to go off soon!! HAHAHA!DUMBASS!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---OOOOOOOOJAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!! GOD I FUCKING HATE THAT WORTHLESS TRIAL!!Who in their right feeeeearrrRIGIN mind would care about that trial??!? its not any different from any other murder trial! Tell those fucking reporters to get a life! And what the fuck do we have to gain by watching that stupid trial anyway? Its not news! its a trial! not news!trail!trialX=Xnews!YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE!!?---Jon binay however the fuck you spell her spoiled ass name Ramsee!!! We dont care! Good fucking riddens!! What the fuck do you expect if you fucking put your kid in all these beauty pagents when shes 4 years old!! SLUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!! I bet her damn dad did it. Fuckin perrrv.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---STUPID PEOPLE!! Why must so many people be so stupid!?YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Making fun of stupid people doing stupid things! Like one time when i was watching this freshman try to get on a computer that needed a password....he typed in the password........and waited. The retard didnt press enter or anything. He just waited. Then he started cussing at the computer saying it was screwed up. Then the freshman went and got a teacher and the fucking teacher could not figure out why it wasnt going anywhere!!! JESUS!! Personaly i think they should be shot.YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Natural SELECTION!!!!! God damn its the best thing that ever happened to the Earth. Getting rid of all the stupid and weak orginisms........but its allnatural! YES!I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom, no more dumbasses. heh.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---ASSHOLES THAT CUT!!!! Why the fuck cant you wait like every other human on earth does. if you cut, you are the following: Stuck up, self centered, selfish, lazy, impatient, rude, and......damn i ran out. anyway. Every fucking line i get into i end up having to wait a fucking hour when there WAS only me and 1 other person in the line!Then the queer sucking asshole lets all his/her so called friends cut in behind em! If that happens 1 more time i will have to start referring to the Anarchists cookbook (bomb section).YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!!?---LIARS!!! OH GAWWWWWWD I HATE LIARS. And living in this fucking neighborhood there is thousands of them!! Why the fuck must people lie so damn much! Especially about stupid things! Like "Yeah, I just bought 5 cases of M-80's in Oklahoma for about $5. And they are legal there and everything. Yeah my parents buy most of my guns, every once in a while ill use my 4,000 dollar paycheck and buy a shotgun or 2. And my brand new hummer just broke down on the highway when i was going 250mph. Stupid cars." like that, now, what fucking part if any would a norman human being believe? And thats just one person!! Another BIG example is Brooks Brown(# removed for privacy's sake). Now, according to him, he has a 215 IQ, 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in Florida), 95mph fast ball(he is only 16), runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to.....Theee Button..., his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sang "r.e.s.p.e.c.t." and the lead singer of Aerosmith. And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents give..GIVE...him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations. Again, according to Brook Brown. OK, when people lie like that, its not impressive, noone believes it, it sounds just plain stupid, and its a fuckin waste of my time.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---R rated movies on CABLE! My DOG can do a better damn editing job than those dumbshits!! For the sake of all television they can atleast try to make it sound like actual words the person would say! If you have ever seen Aliens or Predator youll know what im talking about.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---Windows Keys!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---WAREZ!! Why pay when its free? YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who think they can forecast the weather!! Then they think that everyone else will think that they are cool just because you said that we were gonna have a 4 foot blizzard starting today! like just the other day, this punk i know was saying.."Yeah tomorrow we are gonna get like, 2 feet of snow in just a few hours. They were saying its gonna be the biggest snow in ten years. Yeah itll be about -60 outside too." And that day we get an inch of snow and its 26 out. I feel like getting a baseball bat, breaking it over his head, and then STABBING him with the broken end!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---Country music!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Zippo lighters!!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who say that wrestling is real! now, im talking about the matches like hulk hogan or undertaker. If you think that these matches arent fakes and that these guys are REALLY punching and breaking arms, then please email me. I would love to know where you live so i can BOMB your fucking house and ACTUALLY BREAK YOUR ARMS!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---YOUNG SMOKERS!they think they are so god damn cool with their big bad ciggarettes and their "sooo cool" attitude. I cant wait until they are about 25 and have they have to breathe through their fucking necks and talk with a computer hooked up to their X-vocal cords.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---PAYING FOR MY CAR INSURANCE!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---Freedom of the press. I hate that part of the Bill of Rights.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who are against the death penelty!!! i think the courts should fuckin fry convicts even if all they did was unarmed robbery!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---SCHOOL!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---SCHOOLWORK!YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!?---COMMERCIALS!! OH GAWWD I HATE COMMERCIALS!!! The only ones i MIGHT like are previews and some car commercials. But jesus christ, all those Lotion, PERFUME, Makeup, JCPENNYS, Jostins, food, coffee, or advertisement commercials! Please! Destroy them all! never record another! They suck! They are only funny the first time! Think up other stuff! They suck! They are stupid! We get sick of them VERY FAST! VERY! VERY FAST!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who dont believe in personal hygiene. For the love of god, and for the sake of god, CLEAN UP! Fucking people with 2 inch fingernails and a whole fucking pot full of dirt under them and raggy ass hair or shirts stained to hell. Or people that just plain stink, and they dont do anything about it. Now, im not making fun of anyone if they cant help it, or afford it or anything like that, thats not their fault, but if your some kid drivin a ford explorer and have yellow teeth, then thats just plain unhuman.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who use the same word over and over plain! Like, "actually", or "fuck you", or "bitch". Read a fuckin book or two, increase your vo-cab-u-lary ya fucking idiots.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who try to impress me by TRYING to brag about the militaries weapons! Now, to some of you this might seem, wierd, but its happened. Like this, "dude, they just came out with this new chemical that can destroy denver only by using a cubic inch of it. The military is keeping it all locked up because if it gets to close to water it explode, and the force would create a cresent earth, maaan." Yeah, right, bullshit, or like this, "Dude, the air force has tracked santa clause for like, 10 years now, and he is a real man. its all a cover up." or "The air force just made a plane that can bend light man, its completely invisible." now, this is just some of the shit i've heard. it makes me SICK. And they arent even in the fucking military nore do they know anyone that is!YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE!!?---People who THINK they are martial arts experts! They are all cocky and thinkin that they are all big and bad, saying bullshit like, "yeah if you snap your fingers right here the sound waves will melt the brain and youll die rom your own brain poring out your ears." or "if you flick someone right here their arteries will burst and they will drown in their own blood." fuckin hate it when they keep saying "your own", like it would be someone elses!?!? then when these shitheads get in real fights the get their fuckin asses wooped all over the place by some little girl.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---STARWARS FANS!!! GET A FRIKIN LIFE YOU BORING DICKHEADS!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!---RACISM!!Anyone who belives that blacks, asians, mexicans, or people from any other country or race besides white-american....people who think that should be drug out into the street, have their arms ripped off, be burnt suht at the stumps, then have every person of the race that YOU hate come out and beat the shit out of you. and if you are female, then you should be raped by a male from the race you hate and be forced to raise the child! You people are the scum of society and arent worth a damn piece of worm shit. You all are trash. And dont let me catch you making fun of someone just because they are a different color because i will come in and break your fucking legs with a plastic spoon. i dont care how long it takes! and thats both legs mind you.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---THOSE FUCKING ADVERTISING OR CHARITY CALLS!

Making this post so people with different sexualities can meet! I'm straight:)
im catsexual
Bisexual!!
Pansexual
what is techsexual?
People who are sexually turned on by tech. That's my guess.
oh. thats a new one. at least to me lol
I've only met 2 or 3 people who claim to be techsexual. I guess an android (not the phone) would be what they're looking for, too bad they don't exist, and are usually evil in movies and TV shows, or just emotionless.
And then there's me the gay guy looking for his dark knight in skinny jeans and band tees
i straight and im also looking for that guy haha.

I'm Bisexual and prefer girls to guys. I generally like girls emo or not. But I only seem to be attracted to emo guys. unfortunately there are not many emo girls that are bisexual lor lesbian or near my age of 14 so forever alone XD

The only reason I'm on here is to plan a second holocaust.
I do like the coffee
Coffee is good. Free cocaine though...
nah to cocaine lol
no, myspace is dead. This place always seems to be on the verge of death but idk if it's at that point yet
^Surprisingly enough a lot of new bands still promote their stuff there
i still have my myspace account. it has a pic of me when i was 11 or 12 as the profile pic and hasnt had an update since 2008 but it's there xD
AND..... i don't have tom on my top 8 spaces xD
Well MySpace was originally for bands to promote music. It just blew up and people made it into their own version of a social network site. Then Justin Timberlake took it over and started making it back into what it was originally for. Which is promoting music. xD lol. And that's why it started to "suck as a social media site" and died off. I miss it so much though. It was so great. xD ;^;
More people harassing than ever, unmoderated forums, catfishes, etc yet the creators of the website are able to make a new website for Pokemon GO specifically without even bothering to moderate this site despite the ToS being violated by multiple people multiple times.I might even be going against the ToS posting this, but it doesn't even matter.
Great eye you have there. Never noticed this.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ^ Fuck I love ur spam dude. Appreciate ur raid skills.

Bet Zomb was the kid that sprayed with the AK in CSGO until he dinked someone, switched to p90 next round and prefired like a mother fucker, got double flashed, died, saved for an awp, landed 2 flicks and thinks being a Silver 4 in comp is similar to being a GN2, bc "fuck valve and them turning the rank system upside down". Fuck, this kid...lmfao. with a name like "Zomb", he just plays LoL and can barely get out of Silver on 4 different accounts. Some of which were purchased...kill yourself. This kid defines "trash".
Hello o.o I am bored and wish to make freinds.. o.o
Hi
Maybe be less bored and hit the books instead. With no education, you make no real "freinds".
Agreed.
What's the difference between a pizza and a jew?
pizza's don't scream in the oven.
why are black people so fast?
all the slow ones are in prison
The thing that annoyed me in church is all the standing up sitting and kneeling i wish he would pick a position and fuck me
so it's morning and the bf is drinking milk from the fridge out the bottle. the gf says ''hey stop that it's dirty'' and he says ''last night you had me licking your ass hole and sucking your toes''
As of one year and two weeks ago, the estimated worth of EmoWire was $480.00
Ain't that dandy?
I wonder how much tumblr's worth...
$ 93,600,797. Holy shit.
Wow damn
10k users with probably less than 200 active? Yeah, not surprised lol.
No one gives a shit

Hi
Hey, if you're up for a little bit of fun kik me @ deathwxlking ;p
I need a couple of kinky crazy bastards to call my friends add me if you want!! But be warned imma crazy motherfucker
Heh, I'm pretty kinky
Just curious about what people are attracted to like personality wise mine would be someone who has a strong opinion and knows how to argue that opinion and also someone who is open minded and I guess analyses everything. Physical appearance would be like dark hair with dark eyes I don't know if they smell good they automatically become attractive. So what about you guys what do you guys find attractive?
Well first off I have a dominant personality and I'd very much enjoy being the breadwinner in a household. So one of the things I find attractive in guys is a somewhat submissive personality. When I'm older that'll probably be what I mainly look for. For now, I look for open minded guys who like the same music, hobbies, etc as me. The only physical trait I'm extremely attracted to is long hair. I have no idea why, it's just been like that since I was born. Like even when I was 6 and I'd see random long haired dudes in public I'd be like daaaaamn
What are your spirit animals? Mine personally is a wolf, more specifically Fenrir, as whenever I see a wolf in my dreams, it is chained, with fire in his eyes.
I'm undecided on whether I believe in "spirit animals" but if I do have one it's definitely a black cat.
My spirit animal is human.
I'm a sloth!

But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared
To the back of my mind

Oh, can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Treasure maps, falling trees
Operator please
Call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease

My legs are dangling off the edge,The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.My legs are dangling off the edge,A stomach full of pills didn't work again,I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.
Gone too far and yeah, I'm gone again,It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends,One's a bottle of pills, one's a bottle of gin,I'm 20 stories up, yeah, I'm up at the top,I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,I bet my mamma found my letter, now she's calling the cops,I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,I never bought a suit before in my life,But when you go to meet God, you know you wanna look nice.
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
My legs are dangling off the edge,The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,My legs are dangling off the edge,A stomach full of pills didn't work again,I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.
We hit the sky, there goes the light, no more sun, why's it always night?When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,When you can't dream, well, what's life mean?We feel a little pity, but don't empathizeThe old are getting older, watch a young man die,A Mother and a Son and someone you know, smile at each other and realize you don't,You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,Now Mamma feels guilt, yeah, Mamma feels pain,When you were young, you never thought you'd die,Found that you could but too scared to try,You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
My legs are dangling off the edge,The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,My legs are dangling off the edge,A stomach full of pills didn't work again,I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.
I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,Like a bird so high,Oh I might just try,I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,Like a bird so high,Oh I might just try,Oh I might just try.

The lyrics are edgy. You like those lyrics. As an extention, you, too, are edgy.
That's real fuckin' neato. You're not special for liking "deeper" lyrics.
Deeper? Explain.
Let's see...you're slapping the edgy label on us and then acting like somehow your favorite lyrics are better than all of ours.
Yeah, because it's not funny or edgy.
Oops, "funny, not edgy"

Wow...you have a sense of humor...good for you...you like funny lyrics and we like lyrics we can relate to, makes you superior obv
You're middle-class teens who spend their time. Chances are, you really won't relate to 'em.
*spend their time on the internet
Did you know that depression gives no fucks how old you are, how much time you spend online, or how much money your parents make? Living in the suburbs and having parents who make 100k/year doesn't shield you from mental illness, or being sad in general.

Depressed people can still be edgy. Reasons given above.

Oh, I'm wholly aware what it means.

River Below - Billy Talent
'Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel'

'I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound'

'There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
It is faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think

here is the bulk of my collection of german nazi militaria
the pic of the bayonet is of a k98 bayo that has been used extensively as a closequarter weapon marks of a hand grasp can be clearly seen on the grip it has been grasped so hard and tight that it has left an inprint of the fingers
and on the other pic a inprint of the thumb is vissible
eery but interesting in a morbid way (dried corroded blood stains can be seen on the blade)

i have as many propably have noticed a weird view on things i draw weird stuff and i as now shown collect weird shit so yeah
(this is also the reason most of my relatives dont want me on their fb haha :p )
I feel like people who are offended just have the idea that if you collect wwii memorabilia it means you're a nazi apologist
damn i did not expect nice comments nice to hear that more than me can see the value in collecting such things :D
Oh definitely. I mean we wouldn't have the holocaust museum if it weren't for someone saving the things that were found. It doesn't mean you agree with the ideals of those connected with the items. If anything, keeping such things can be used for educational purposes. As long as you don't agree with the ideals, which you already stated that you don't, then I don't see a problem with collecting historical stuff like this.
It's important to preserve these things. We can't let future generations not be aware of the horrors Hitler caused.
yeah i mean things like post mortem i mean that piece of dead meat used to have feelings,emotions,relatives,views on things, personality nad now its a cold piece of meat just like a piece of pig meat, a person who now is on the same level as a dead pig. and that scares and fascinates me that life ends and the human stops being human and becomes dead cold meat.
and those skulls are a bitch to find since the stuff related to the ss was mostly destroyed after the war so i try to grab all things ss that comes my way as of now i have beltbuckle and that eagle the dude in the pic has and this totenkopf
Ow, the edge.
^everything nonconformist is edgy to you isn't it?
It's not "nonconformist", it's just edgy.
It doesn't conform to normal society, therefore it's somewhat nonconformist. Typical civilians don't collect nazi memorabilia. You should really stop throwing that word around. You're pretty edgy too, so...
Me? Edgy? Explain.
You're 14 and think you're superior to other kids, and that is my definition of it. People who think they're "different".

No, what I mean is I only think I'm superior to you all.
Hahaha but you're not
Yeah. I am.
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure.

Nice delusion you got there, mate.
oh cassttess9 how could your life possibly be so meaningless that your nr 1 goal in life is to create troll accounts on alternative sites?
dont you have a girlfriend or something to be with, well judging by hte way you behave my guess is you dont have one and just a heads up MATE if you put in as much effort in getting a girl or meaning as you do in trolling people you would be alot happier. because im getting both irritated and amused at seeing your name with the next consecutive nr so 9 huh? this is your 9th acc?! damn where the fuck did your life go?
and i have allways found war incredibly interessting and in a sick way alluring since you go out with the strict mindset to kill the opposing soldiers, to end another mans life. and that is what i find the most fascinating about war and death is that it could all end in 1sec with a well placed bullet anytime anywhere you might sit with your pals having a coffee thinking you are safe and the next thing you know the guy infront of you who you have known for 5 years and fought with gets a bullet from seemingly nowhere right in the back of his skull ending his life his memories and shattering his family making them irrepairable. one bullet can cause so much damage and i find it fascinating that wars are a symphony of death orcestrated with artillery and highcallibre rifles, a symphony that claims not one families wellbeing for all time but millions of families.

ok but you know what? a trolls worst enemy is silence
so yeah i wont respond anymore and i urge everyone to do the same
so cassettes radiosilence is in effect as of now.
I'm pretty sure someone'll respond at one point or another.
"nice delusion you got there mate" haha...so I'm delusional that you're not better than everyone on this site? Please.
See? De-lu-sions.
Go make useful contributions to society, then we'll talk superiority.
this gives me ideas for a project of Preserving history..
BulletForMySilentSuicide said:
useful contributions to society
lmao nothing I'm 17. Nobody on this site is superior to anyone else, that's my point.
Bullets is right. Its the truth mate.
yeah preserving history is a realy important part of a society even if this kind of collecting is considered extremely taboo (infact many if not the majority even of antique shops will show you the door if you even hint at looking for ns memorabilia) so its important to establish solid suppliers who will get to know you and consider you a regular on the buyers list (that way you can get first dibs before stuff even comes online for everyone else)

Nice. How do you keep this stuff clean without damaging it?


this is also one of the new pickups its a piece of a helmet camo for a waffen ss helmet and a "nahkampfspange" closequartercombat clasp wich you got rewarded with for being in an area where you had to engage in closequarter combat (knife to knife) for 2 weeks
well i clean some things in acid baths mixed with alot of water and hats and such cant be cleaned i only brush of dust and stuff and check for moths since some of them have been in a basement or attic for 60-65 years so cnatrealy do much about that (the hats stink of old mold to)
What are dark things you liked as a kid that maybe set the foundation for you being into emo subculture? When I was 6 I had an obsession with the The Phantom of the Opera. Then when I was 10 I played Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness for the first time and it became my favorite video game, and at the same time I was obsessed with the Twilight movies (which I hate now, don't worry lmao).

i guess blood lol i like seeing blood. just its colour. red isnt even my fav colour so i dunno.
zombies, spiders, gore, horror movies, demons, spirits, death, knives, fire(kindof a pyro , especially when i played with flaming beyblades XD) , bloody marry, creepypastas, asked for a ouija board at 5yo, and cemetaries.
I would play with knives and razors when i was around 7 years old.
I really got obsessed with Harry Potter when I'm 10 and I really look forward to receive a letter from Hogwarts but unfortunately I didn't. So I went with the alternative a distant friend of mine helped me and I was beyond happy. My mom barely noticed that I sneak out so the story goes on but then I stop at the age of 13 coz I finally realized my real path in life.

I had a strange obsession with demons and to some extent torture devices. o_o I could never harm another person, unless it came to a life or death situation.
But on another note. My interest for demons came up when I watched the movie called 'The Crow" haha. A bit of a gory movie in my opinion for a yougner audience.
The Crow is not as gory as what kids these days are watching. When I was 11 I knew a kid who was obsessed with Saw.
How could I forget SAW? That's basically my childhood.
You're a very intelligent individual. I enjoy that in all honesty.
I honestly never read the satanic bibe. I'm lost on where I stand on religion but I know evolution proved more facts that something more than us.
I was really into witchcraft when I was younger. Heck. I still am.
I think I can't say I used to but I quiet been like that long ago but I stop for a reason.
I loved horror movies since I was really little. 
well i had a morbid fascination of death and the other side since an early age and have since then read and researched all kinds of paranormal shit its one of my biggest interests (demons, ghosts, orbs, black magic, cryptozoologi etc etc) and have since i was like 12 been extremely interested in all things nazi germany and their occult practices (for example heinrich himmler the leader of the ss praised the black sun an old pagan symbol)

I liked killling/decapitating animals I would find in the woods near my house as a kid. But that's old news.
I've been lookein for a while and i didn't find any.what do u say?
Listen to spoken, they are a good band.
And that one song Jenny.....
By nothing more.
here are some underrated ones you might like:
Rites of Spring (the original emo band)
Hawthorne Heights
Red Jumpsuit Apparatus
La Dispute
It'd probably be easier for people to look up bands if you actually wrote down the name of the bands and not just a bunch of acronyms.

I wan't the slow ones.is that slow?
Um thts bcuz i dnt really hv a band t listn
They do have some more, well, whiny emotional music.....
Looks like you're also misissing some vowels on your keyboard...
Skillet, Get Scared and Black Viel Brides, for example.
Dashboard Confessional is a slower emo band (they're acoustic). You might like them.
Blue Foundation and that song "wulf" by Now Now
American Football is probably the most popular emo band of all time. You should also listen to Rites of Spring since they're credited as the first or one of the first emo bands. The Jazz June, Prawn, The World Is  a Beautiful Place and I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, Dikembe, and Midwest Pen Pals are some good, recent ones.

Rites of Spring only made one album but it's a gem. Worth the listen.
Thanks, fam. I know everything about everything.
I love both Skillet and Three Days Grace but neither one is an emo band last time I checked.
Idk if these are emo or not, but I love... My Chemical Romance, Sleeping With Sirens, Fall Out Boy, Pierce The Veil, panic! At the disco, Blessthefall, for all those sleeping, never shout never, green day, black veil brides, asking alexandria, nirvana, attila, all time low, twenty one pilots, bring me the horizon, smashing pumpkins, the pixies, AC/DC, falling in reverse, a day to remember, get scared and muse (I love lots more but I cba to type)
None are emo, ESPECIALLY Nirvana, The Pixies, Muse, and AC/DC.
Have you tried listening to In This Moment?
THIS IS ALL PUSSY MUSIC. YOU WANT EMO? TRY WANG CHUNG.

BulletForMySuicideSilence is very right,except mcr still counts as emo along with ptv.I don't know enough about sws or patd,and I'm not sure about fob...
Haha yeah,but they're still good I guess.I don't like them very much but they certainly aren't bad.
^NO. Neither ptv nor mcr are emo bands. Thought I was clear when I said "none of those bands are emo".

Sleeping with Sirens and Panic! aren't emo either.

dude, emo kids listening to a certain band is not what makes the band emo please learn your shit
What are your best insults without swear words? Even better, invent a swear (if you please)!
you should just be the way you were created:-)
^She was created as a girl trapped in a man's body, end of discussion. Problem?

Don't you ever pull that "just be the way you were created!!" bullshit on any transgender individual.
If you really want to be cis passing it's fine but IMO, why should it matter what others think?

I totally understand where you're coming from on this one :( I'm a trans male and people always tell me I pass but I know I don't :/ thankfully you're on estrogen and you're on your way to passing. I'm not on hormones yet but just believe it'll get better :)

Kek
The one spammer I didn't report
























How and when exactly did you all find your way to here? I personally joined this 2 years ago (when I actually identified as "emo") around thanksgiving while in Florida when I googled "emo social media" and only was on it for a week before I got grounded and soon forgot about it. Then, around Christmas this year I remembered about it and rejoined, and, lo and behold, here I am.
Someone from another site I was on told everyone that they joined. I was curious, so I did too.
And then messed with people and got reported, and now you're on your 11th account. XD
Yeah, pretty much. It's quite boring now.
This site sadly seems to be dying. People are leaving left and right.
Sadly? This is a pretty shitty site, that's not the term you should really be using.
It's entertainment, at the very least
I suppose.
It's time for you to come out
Go cause some drama or something.
HELLO
IT ME

I AM VERY FUNNY
This isn't a comedy club :') the sites called emo wire dude, I'm sure your not surprised to hear that your classic "emo" isn't exactly the master of comedy xD
If you call yourself funny then you probably aren't. "xD tacos rawr im so random" doesn't count as comedy.

@Dumbgirl no u r just stupid

@bulletformysilentsuicide yeah true.

I am lonely.

Well, i regret clicking on this.
lmfao, nice.
I used to play violin, I still have it around for old times sake.
Do my vocal chords count
piano
Yeah, your vocals count. :P

I wish I could play piano :o
No honestly you don't it's super hard I could barely play the happy birthday song XD
i sing and scream
I play the saxaphone...and bass guitar ^~^
Grade 5 drums.
yeah, I play guitar and did the production for my bands demos for our EP.
we don't have any vocals yet unfortunately BUT we managed to get Spencer Charnas from Ice Nine Kills to do guest vocals on our cover of Take One Last Breath :D
^Aaaaa dude that's awesome!
Vocals.
I started off on a recorder way back in the day like many children (like, 8 years old I think?), switched to a Clarinet a couple years later. I used to be able to read sheet music really well but my music theory is mega rusty since I haven't had to use it in nearly half a decade. I bought myself an electric guitar a little over three years ago. It took a tragic fall at the hands of my boyfriend and busted one of the tuning pegs off so it was out of commission until a few months ago. I've played pretty much constantly since I've gotten it fixed. As of a couple weeks ago I've been getting into bass guitar too cx I'm also a singer, clean vocals only.
Finally XD I play Acoustic electric and classical guitar. Piano and I sing mainly, do you have a YouTube channel
Yeah, this should send you my cover of Sail by AWOLNATION and you can navigate from there to get to my channel

^very obvious troll is very obvious
I used to be a music ed major when I first went to college. I play piano, alto saxophone, guitar, autoharp, and I sing. But music ed majors had to learn to play all instruments. I only made it through some of the brass, and started violin and what not right before I quit. To me the hardest instruments were the orchestral string instruments. Cudos to anyone who plays them. I taught myself how to play guitar and autoharp though. I play mountain music on them ^-^
5 string Bass 32 fret from XRB
I try to sing but lose my voice most the time.I'm kind of bad at piano but I'm trying.I play cello,six string guitar and bass guitar.I consider myself to be pretty awesome at the guitars on a good day.I practice roughly 20-25 hours all together per week.

HOW ABOUT A DINOCAT

So a few people I know struggle with self harm and when they wear short sleeves they have bandages on there arms. Sometimes I will write encouraging words on them and remind them to stay strong. It actually helps sometimes and I'm happy but... No one ever writes anything on mine. Do they not notice or just don't care. I just want some encouraging words on my bandages for once.
I don't struggle with self harm, but I do know the feeling of trying to lead happiness onto others when they don't do so back to you. During some times in your life, you may just need to solve your problems on your own. Do not worry if no one writes anything on your bandages. You can write things on your bandages yourself, so you should! Some people do different things, and maybe some people aren't into doing that whole writing on bandages thing. My point is just try to stand alone on the whole bandage writing thing. With the whole self harming issue, I can't really give any advice on that, but I'm pretty sure there are people on this website that may be able to help you. That's why you're on this site after all, right? To seek help? Good. That's the first step into conquering this crappy problem known as self harm, to seek help. I myself haven't attempted self harm, but I have had thoughts on it. Alternatives I've done is doing things like biting not too hard on my tongue or just letting all my feelings out on my iPod's notepad or something. Either way, you must find alternatives to self harm that can help you. Again, I don't self harm so I can't really say much. Go and find people that self harm or used to self harm about it and see how they contain the need to do so. Good luck!

Thank you so much. You don't understand how thankful I am for that. I'm trying to get better and it's going slowly but it's still going. Again, thank you so very much. :)
No problem. Good to know I could help.

I want guys and girls to comment on this, see how controversial it can get xD
no, and it's not like we can control it. If you're confident about your body that's all that matters.

It's like guys with abs. It's nice but it doesnt really matter. You wont like or dislike a girl because of her boob size xD
Nah it doesn't, a guy should love you for you, not your tits. If it's breasts and thighs he wants then send him to KFC
That last comment was so perfect lmao xD
well it should not just be for outside looks that a guy/girl likes you. beauty is only skin deep. besides if thats all us girls were judged for, I personally would be screwed. xD
He didn't say it was the only reason to date a girl, but not being attracted to someone is a valid reason not to want to be in a relationship. You can be attracted to someone both mentally and physically. I can agree with that.

To weigh in on the main subject, boob size doesn't matter as long as they still look good. Honestly, I prefer small boobs but that doesn't mean I wouldn't date someone with larger breasts and enjoy them just the same. Breast size matters about as much as dick size.
I don't even understand why people make a huge deal out of dick size
exactly what I've said, it's not the only reason to date a girl, and it's one of the least important reason. But! it's there and everyone do it, even you, everyone has it's preferences and you can't force someone to love you if they are not interested. You can't create attraction if there is none, and it's hard to create an entire relationship when there is no attraction.

thats agreeable.
I'm more of an ass lover kinda guy myself.
I like them small ,i dont like big boobs ,i think small are the best.....thats just me ,maybe because i am a butt guy idk
But main key is personality....
If it's breasts and thighs he wants then send him to KFC
That's so great thank you @Mynamewasjef for that.As someone who's been harassed about that kind of stuff I appreciate the prespective.
big boobs are for me atleast (and then i mean BIG you know the kind that most guys say they want the kind that can suffocate you) a turnoff it doesnt even look good i mean i like boobs that i can grab not ones that can kill me
Ok a nice set a boobs is nice but if thats what he wants that aint love that is fucking lust. Love is about personality and so much more like caring and compassion. If he is worried about your boob size then kick him out the door cuz #REALBOOBIESDABEST. Honestly if your boobs are big and fake you a fake ass motherfucka
ofc boobs are not in any way shape or form crucial in the decision making of dating someone i mean that is just weird and frankly if i found out one of my friends chose his girl by putting them to like a boobchart i would end that friendship since that is sick and i could never ever respect that person ever again
Every boob is beautiful 
^aw that's sweet lol ty
I can't explain it, but I just love them 
I don't and can explain it.
I may be cliche with this,but -no.I think it's more of the personality that is important. :3

I feel that it's definitely more about personality but we have to admit it we all judge off of something else first I mean the first thing u do is look at a person and then get to k ow them I honestly wish it wasn't this way but it's kinda how it works at least in my perspective
About anything music art lamps oxygen IDC lol
I'll talk to you
Same.I'd like to talk.
Ok hi to both of you xD
I don't believe in soulmates. I think that, love and relationships need a lot of effort and a lot of time in order to work correctly. Your relation will work if you put enough effort in it.
This is much more interesting than I expected it to be.
I believe in soulmates.
Then where the frick is mine?
Wait I don't have a soul...
most likely antarctica lol
I'm pretty sure thats where mine is
that, or hell. One of the two.
Sometimes the person who is your soulmate may not seem like it (sorry to anyone who hasn't watched Gilmore Girls, but there's a perfect opportunity for a reference), like Rory and Jess. A soulmate, to me, is someone you just click with, and put up with them cause people can really get on your nerves, even ones ur destined to be with lol
Same about the soul thing.
I know that just because your Soulmates it doesn't mean that you wont fight cause that's human nature its about being able to fight with them and still being there for each other.
Soulmates is about connecting with people on a deeper level then what you do with most people and yes they may have flaws and yes you may fight but that's what makes us human. A soul mate will accept your flaws and forgive you when you fight. Soul mates is when to different people come together on a deeper level and connect as one
For me, I was on day 8 of a 10 day exercise with about 5 hours of sleep total. We were sitting in the back of our LAV crusing down one of the dirt roads with the hatches up. Now it hadn't rained in for about a week and a half so dust was filling the crew compartment pretty rapidly but that's ok. It's not a country road cruise without breathing in a shitload of dust. Somebody had also brought their ipod and one of those mini portable speakers so there was music to go along with it as well. While it was country and I'm not a fan of country music whatsoever, I was fine with it because I was so tired that any music would have been nice. Also, the speaker was shit but whatever. Combination of sleep deprivation, sitting down, crusing along a dusty dirt road, beautiful weather, music and good company. I couldn't help but get this sense of relaxation. And that, was probably the most content I've ever been in my life
When I found out the guy I had been dating for three years, already had a girlfriend before we even met. That wasn't my happiest moment, but it was when I found out and my best friend (who now is my boyfriend), supported me through all of it. He listened and cared for me, at any time. He called me in the middle of his work to comfort me whilst I was crying over him. And a half a year later, we started dating, we've been together for a bit over half a year now, even though it feels like a year already. He takes care of me and I've never felt this loved and happy in my life before.
for me I can say when I was with my big brother he use to always care for me no matter what he will always be supportive and protective he was the one who help me when my dad will be drunk at night but after his death I lost all happiness: ( cause now Am all alone in this world
Literally any time I cuddle with one of my friends or my crush talks to me. I feel so happy and content in those moments.
mine was on a drive and it was raining and they played really good music on the radio . The music the sound of rain and the beautiful scenery was just sooo hve no words to discribe it .the moment was just perfect and I never felt this content ever 
 in my life
In the good ol' days of partying with friends and getting wasted on all those toxins... Before I became a reclusive wreck, that prefers partying by myself but never feel genuinely happy. 
Those gorgeous summer days, out by the ocean or on one of the islands... Smoking weed, my favourite music in my ears, smoking cigarettes and dropping LSD. Man.. Thinking of all the other times I've been genuinely happy I think, hurts.? Knowing it's been years since I felt a true serge of euphoria.
a couple weeks after my bf and I started dating. It was a nice clear night. we were sitting on a roof cuddling after eating pizza. and he was teaching me about the stars and space and his alien theories. I was just so content :)
I used to, not anymore
Any Canadians out there? Curious as to what it's like over there. I'm planning on living there maybe find a man.
Sir YES Sir! I'm Canadian
Awesome. I would like to hear what it's like over there. :)
it's cold and we have snow everywhere, beside that it's ok
That is awesome. If it snows in summer then thank God I'm moving over there
I'm Canadian too!
Awesome XD Go Canada! Is it actually snowing in every area or certain places like U.s.
I have never seen snow :(
Awesome and man that sucks :(. Thanks for the advice, my reason is not for Trump I've actually always wanted to go there. If it's really actually peacful it's what I need. Tired of this place. So rude and rascist here. I know it doesn't make a difference but I like to explore. Crazy stuff has been happening here.

yeah I think Montreal is the worst city in Canada
I can agree with that, Montreal is like a 3rd world country city
Ah, really? :/ why? I've always loved it I like the diversity and different cultures. I guess it depends on the neighborhood.
If I ever go sight seeing what would you all recommend.
If I ever go sight seeing what would you all recommend.
The biodome, the old port, the botanical garden, st joseph oratory (all these are in montreal)
Lol I thought it wasn't a good idea to go there though. XD
(+would you meet up irl)?
You can make real friends anywhere
And yeah I would meet up with them if we became good enough friends c:
well I would meet them if they were not far from me that could be nice.
I've made friends on here and I've always wished they lived closer so we could hang out ir. :3
@Triskali that's basically how I am.
I'm glad some people actually responded.Irl people can't even tell me if we're friends or why we are.
Might be stupidly optimistic of me, but I like to think so.
Again why I joined.I had some hope in something for once so I tried it out.So far this is the best online community I've been to.
what happend?
Shes fine just talk to her on kik
I made this topic cause I'm a little skeptical....

Q: 
Someone told me that the life style I've been living is dead, we're in 2016 and it's so 2009 apparently........
Then I told her she's tripping._.


Anyone else have an opinion? 
A: ?
Not really lol. imo it's less flamboyant than in 2006 but 2015 was considered the emo renaissance year. And I mean most of the emo bands from 2006 are still making music, and warped tour is still a thing, so...
I like to believe that it lives on, but not at the climax that 2006-2009 seemed to hold. It's much more rare and it isn't the original, but it's still there.
Basically what anodyneocean said. Its climax/golden age has passed but that doesn't mean we can't participate in it. Of course I daydream about being a high school student in 2004-2007 and having an emo squad, and going to MCR and AFI shows...oh man that's my dream life right there tbh
Who doesn't dream of that?
pretty much dead but i like to live in the past and pretend im a myspace famous scene queen so just do what u want heh early 2000s emo/scene is cute im not too fond of the new wave stuff
I personally live in the mindset of the past, but I have some favourite modern bands.
I have 2 emo moods: 2006 (mcr, afi, paramore, etc) or 2016 (metalcore/deathcore) there's no in between

how i remember it is in 2005 emo really started becoming popular, in 2006 emo really started to become a mainstream thing and stayed that way pretty much until 2008. that's just how i remember the 2000's xD i'm in my 20's now and wouldn't exactly walk around telling everyone i'm emo like when i was a kid. but emo certainly has changed :p
Does anyone listen to my long list of depressing poetry that sounds so deep but yet sounds like it doesn't make any sense at all?
Is anyone here into Ddlg?
I'm somewhat into md/lb
Hmm nice. Do you have a Dom already?
If I were fully into it, I'd be the dom.

Did you just... Yep. Well done, you've managed to stoop lower than me.
Do you want one? Ask me! The thopic doesn't matter (movies, animes, games, comics or just something in your head -u-)
draw me yaoi xD
Fiiinishedddd 
What is your opinion on boobz?
I personally think they shouldn't be considered sexual
But they are attractive...
They should be considered sexual.
if they can give a man a boner it's sexual.
Anything could give a guy a boner...even a lamp
Now way. Silent suicide.get real.
Damien, have you ever got a boners from an object?
If men can go outside shirtless, women should be able to if they want to. I personally don't, but I'm not the only girl who matters
Lmao you're a girl, who're you to say what can and can't give men boners
Men don't nurse children.
Wooooow, booblical argument
The only reason breasts are considered sexual is because religious society decided we should cover ourselves completely hundreds of years ago. In, say, ancient Egypt, it was perfectly norman for anyone to go outside half nude in warm weather.
Like if you don't feel comfortable showing your bare breasts that's 100% fine but you shouldn't keep women who want to from doing so.

Sorry for being the "annoying feminist" here, but western society is hypersexual.
I don't even think it's illegal
There's exception to be topless in America, like in New York I think it's allowed but it's technically illegal to flirt with strangers in New York
silent suicide is right, anything will give us guys boners... even lamps.
Yah..... It's called a fetish......
LAMP FETISH
Well my friend breasts are an eroginous zone as well as a means of feeding a baby. Surely you know what eroginous means, when touched in a way, the nerves tell the brain that feels good. Raising serotonin levels causing a feeling of love and lust. Sexual, yes, attractive, yes but to be treated respectfully.
Well said
It's all about culture and what we have been tought as a kid , there are many countries in Africa that boobs aren't considered as a sexual part but there are also many muslim countries that even arms are considered as a sexual part !
I mean im close with my friends & they know that im 38DD so when i do ...just about anything *snaps my fingers* instant bonner.....
what the hell did we do to get picked we never hurt anyone,we just want to be ourselves
I must admit that I never heard of someone hating train lovers xD It's all in your head

I've never heard that either. I freaking love trains!! I used to think I wanted to be a train conductor :3
And that almost looks like a cyanide and happiness drawing xD
to clean the things up i mean like people who dont understaind it and mainly the assholes of life.
I knew a few kids who loved trains commit sucide for bullying
KYS don't follow him follow me im funnier and also if you watch me you'll be saving my life because I'll kill myself if you don't
I wasn't talking to you ya fuck

Who else exslpors abandoned buildings,for fun?
For us it was an abandoned glass factory that was on the outskirts of town, This place is surounded by huge woods and even some wierd things, Its called the Pumphouse (because near it is the illionois river) This place wonderous for those that wander there, you an see the typical graffiti on the front side of the building, going on, and its a completly different story on the inside you have strange markings on the wall resembling what looks like ritual markings and such. It was a creepy building and Sometimes people have gone ghost hunting at night.
it also has a bunch of tunnels and multiple outbuildings around it, there of course is shitons of broken glass around it, If you stay there for awhile you also sometimes feel like your being watched. However the place is fun to camp out at, Exploring abandoned buildings is awesome!
I exsplor this old mill and a near by asylum at night and sometimes during the day. the asylum has a demonic vibe like a dark force is there but the mill just feels empty nd cold.
the asylum might get torn down
Wow. This is depressing. .-.

If you want dark, look into my soul and you will realise the true insanity that lies inside of me.
You guys can be so cringe worthy. It's actually nauseating.

I followed you ^^
Thank you!!
Command and Conquer is a famous RTS franchise that along with Starcraft and Dune 2000, started this genre of gaming, I have played ever CNC game that is out there and Im wondering if this site has any CNC fans. For those who have never Played the CNC franchise go here.
What CNC games have you played if you do know what CNC is and have played it?
Well I guess I don't need any friends on here i was just be all alone and be worthless fake stupid annoying cunt on here
Well now, ask and you shall recieve. I love people who automatically guess there is no hope merely because of a simple waiting game. Anyways, if you would like to have friends, perhaps you should post more on the main area or maybe even talk to people. If you would like, i am open for conversation.
I understand. It takes time to accept who and what you might be. But i shall tell you this, i shall not pass such judgments upon you considering my own stance in the matter. My own sanity is questionable and i can accept that you may not be good at conversing, but in all honesty, the only people who are good are those who lie, who practice the same lies over and over again always prepared to tell someone. Dont be ashamed of who you are, be mindful of those around you who see you as something more.
What ... ?
I apologize for using such high vocabulary, i tend to forget that not many people in my age group or even higher can understand my heightened word use.
oh it's okay and um thanks =)
*sighs* Pitty pitty pitty....
No actally my words are sometimes weird and insane and sometimes I like to be insane
I'm a weirdo though
wow this argument has gone places.
Perhaps you should've looked at her own stance before "pointing out" such things. Understanding her disposition, you could've easily avoided this wasteful argument, but perhaps you wished to fuel the flames.
Interesting......

i want to get a tattoo of talley marks, but I want them to mean something. I thought about having them stand for people I've lost but I have only lost one person I was close to. Any ideas? Thank you bunches 
you could get the gammadion cross on your forehead, it's a really meaningful symbol
Kikiroh said:

It'd have to be up to you if you really want it to be meaningful. By the sounds of it, it seems like you just want it as a tattoo because you think it looks cool. I'm not against getting tattoos for that reason, but asking a bunch of people on the internet why you should get it as a tattoo kind of defeats the purpose of wanting it to hold meaning, does it not?
thank you, my stupid joke earlier was just to make that point but I couldn't find the words for it. If you want a tattoo but have to ask about what it should be, you shouldn't get one.
Thank you guys but the real reason I asked was because I needed excuses to tell my parents what it means. They're cool with a tattoo and everything but the actual meaning is something I don't feel comfortable sharing. I was trying to find something believable to tell them.  Thank you guys tho 
I'm a training tattoo artist. I hear stuff like this at least once a week, and have to try and talk people out of it just as often. I dunno, if you want something because it looks cool, at least admit that's the reason behind it. Don't try and pull meaning out of your ass, it makes you look pretentious.
You can just say it stands for the day or month or the person's favorite number who died? Kinda disrespectful towards the person but would sound believable.
Thank you. That sounds like a good idea.
How the hell should i die :/ anybody?how can i hide the  piercing on my noes :/
I'm sure I read this yesterday... o.O
Yeah i've posted this before
Aaaaah, I seee

Meh
This site needs some changes....
I do use a laptop and it's working for me
Try posting to YouTube then linking it if nothing else works.
If you are going to try drinking blood just take precautions since blood can be infected easily or infect a person, so try to get those machines used for blood transaction, and stuff like that. -Just sayin'
YOU'RE NOT A VAMPIRE. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO LOOK COOL AND EDGY. DON'T DRINK BLOOD, YOU'RE GONNA GET INFECTED WITH ALL KINDS OF SHIT.
Cassettes, would you PLEASE stop harassing people over this kind of crap? She NEVER said she wanted to feel special. If otherkin helps her cope with depression you need to leave her the fuck alone.

You are 13. Act like it. You're shitting on people you think are fishing for attention but you obviously think you're highly intelligent for your age.

No, I don't think Im highly intellegent. It's just this is quite silly. And honestly, looks a bit like pedo fishing for kids. Iunno.
Punk, you're either on the wrong forum thread and meant to post in the otherkin thread, or you're seriously advocating that this chick goes around asking for blood donors. 

If you have an issue with the otherkin topic, go there. If you're going to contribute to the conversation, do so, but chewing people out for their opinions doesn't do  anything productive. I think it's completely normal for otherkin to be seen as attention seekers (given the tumblrkin takeover). I've been in the otherkin community for 5 years now (and I mean the real one that's been online since the 90s, not this new wave shit that tumblr is perpetuating) and I've seen god knows how many skeptics and "otherkin" who just want to be special snowflakes. It's like running into 12 year olds who think they have major depression because their hormones are acting up and they feel sad, so they diagnose themselves. With otherkin there's plenty of people who go "wow I like cats, I must totally be a cat. Guys. I'm a cat. Wow.", and that's not even in the same realm as otherkinity. Sadly, that's the majority of otherkins on the Internet, and it means it's absolutely acceptable for outsiders to criticise the community at this point.
ew why would she need blood from a donor...this is probably someone who wants to either murder people or sell blood on the black market.

Was 3 AM when I posted that. Didn't read OPs post much. I didn't remember this until 10 minutes ago.

AnodyneOcean is correct about that.
I actually think vampires are very real but they aren't nearly stupid enough as to be present online, or in common society period.
I see nothing wrong with pretending to be a vampire because it's cool, as long as people doing it are doing it because they like it and not for attention. As a kid I liked to pretend I was Lara Croft, I just thought she was awesome I didn't want to draw attention.
I can see your point but it depends on place and situation, not all "vampires" are nice, some can be pretty much proud so is rather to take precaution on your pretense to not do it in a ignorant or insulting way or to at least let them know just to avoid any unessary conflict. As you research more about them or any lifestyle subculture(urban culture) you can see why pretending because is cool is not the brightest idea because most of the time you can come as ignorant or rude to people within the culture. But thank you for letting me see other aspects.
AnodyneOcean is saying to relate in a spiritual sense like Native Americans that is the basic idea of otherkin started. Also humans are animals under the species labeled as mammals.

I guess you could say that but is more like a spiritual and mental in a way but not a physical thing. Like religious people tend to say that they are god's vessels send to help and guide people is more of a spiritual mindset type of thing, that idea is similar to otherkin, but their idea is more based as reincarnation.

I don't need to answer your question as silly as it is. I think trying to put shame on other is horrible. I'm not saying he's wrong calling someone else fake. He's just an asshole.

Assholes are blind to their assholery.
GrayFox never bashes on anyone actually...
yup you are blind and so is your friend. I'm sorry but unlike you I don't enjoy hurting other in their privacy. I don't enjoy public shaming. And I don't agree with what you are doing.
it's not what I've seen on the forum and on some people wall. He seems to enjoy bashing on people.
How the hell is calling someone out on IMPERSONATING A WELL KNOWN YOUTUBER invasion of privacy?
How about people should stop trying to humiliate other because it's only what I've seen so far
Humiliating them would be actually posting on their profile saying they're fake. Noticing they run a fake profile and reporting them is not humiliation.
And lemme tell you something you seem to be ignoring here. Sometimes, people use photos that aren't them because they have low self-esteem, yes. But sometimes they use photos that aren't them because they genuinely get off on lying. And can you try to think of the people being impersonated? It's not all about the person doing the impersonating.
well making a public blog about it is humiliation. what's going on is humiliation. For christ he even asked people to unfriend and report the person. Not only it's a public humiliation but he is asking for hatred on that person. Sorry but it's not cool.
lemme tell you something. you have no moral.
and a serious lack of empathy.
I do have to agree with Joncha
Someone making a post asking other to unfriend someone, naming that person. That's fishy as fuck, not cool.
Well, i agree telling someone to unfriend someone is mean, but telling people that someone is fake isn't mean.

It's not all about the person doing the impersonating.
well making a public blog about it is humiliation. what's going on is humiliation. For christ he even asked people to unfriend and report the person. Not only it's a public humiliation but he is asking for hatred on that person. Sorry but it's not cool.
lemme tell you something. you have no moral.
and a serious lack of empathy.
I do have to agree with Joncha
Someone making a post asking other to unfriend someone, naming that person. That's fishy as fuck, not cool.
Well, i agree telling someone to unfriend someone is mean, but telling people that someone is fake isn't mean.

The fakes, oh how the fakes think I care how they feel. Joncha, lemme tell you something, SHUDDAFUG UP YA TROLL
hahahAHAHA telling someone they're an asshole makes them the WORST? Are you SURE? WORSE THAN HITLER?
lol why you bring hitler in that? it makes no sense you are dense xDDDD
I'm simply telling others to unfriend and report someone impersonating someone else. Is that wrong? It is of course their decision nonetheless. Either way, does this person not deserve to be unfriended? It's someone pretending to be someone else. Stealing someone's identity and making it your own is wrong. Even if I was a fake (which is your choice to believe or not) bashing on another fake, if that were the case, we're both assholes. Someone stealing someone's identity does not make them not an asshole. If you are stealing someone's identity and claiming it, for fucks sake, YOU ARE A FUCKING ASSHOLE. I am proud to announce that people who catfish are assholes. Their story does not make them less of an asshole. If you're teased by the way you look, SIMPLY DO NOT POST PICTURES OF YOURSELF. Have a profile picture of your favorite character, celebrity, I don't know, a brick for all I care. It is wrong to steal peoples identity and it should be stopped. I am telling people to do certain actions for certain reasons. Unfriend someone that is not what the other person may think they are. Report someone that is stealing someone's identity. Simple actions, simple reasons. I don't care what any of you say, I did the right thing posting this. You guys can bitch and whine all you want, all I bring is justice.
this isn't any justice. This is judge bully executionner.
It's justice to putting a catfish where they belong, banned.
You want so much to be a saint, don't you Joncha?
Agreed, joncha, go fuck yourself in a corner, with a knife...

You're a fake also Joncha
the only thing I see here is 3 bullies that need to be together and spam insult on one single person in order to feel better about themself.
All I see here is three educated real people, and one stupid, fake, troll.

Go get a life, stop being a dick.
mhmm educated people that call other assholes and humiliate other for their own fun. Asking other to go fuck themself is being educated? No I keep what I've said on you all. All bullies.
Joncha, I hope you understand I give ZERO fucks about how you feel, I mean, calling out a fake, isn't uneducated,. But I've seen you're an ass, like, just GET A REAL PROFILE XD, most fakes are useless trolls, like YOU
Well that escalated quickly.

Joncha you're like tumblr SJWs; you find anything and everything offensive, you have an inability to mind your own business (ie you make everything about yourself), you think everyone who doesn't think exactly like you is a bully, and then you think you're heroic.
If I wanted to feel better about myself, I'd do good deeds not harass people. Did it just fly over your head that I was severely bullied from ages 8 to 13?
Don't try to use fancy words to find excuses, you're an ass and a bully there is nothing else to know about all 3 of you.
Joncha gtfo
GrayFox you are a jerk and you just seems to enjoy yourself hurting other shame on you.
Nope, I enjoy giving back to people.
You enjoy hurting other even when they have not provoked you.
Only if this person is a fake like YOU XD

Fake lives are FAKE, and fake things don't matter, so in my eyes YOU DONT FUCKING MATTER
in my eyes you are a imbecile, a bully, a jerk and a douchebag
Well, you are fake,  AND FAKE OPINIONS DONT MATTER, SOOO

GO KILL YOUR FAKE ASS
see... death threats. It just tell a lot about you.
Only toward fakes XD

LIKE I SAID, ZERO FUCKS ABOUT YOU.
still you are a shitty person.
and you are only going to attract other shitty people in your life xDDDD
LIKE I SAID, IDGAF ABOUT FAKES.
simple mind :3 you seems to give a lot of fucks since you keep talking
Nope, zero fucks, I just keep talkin cuz it is HILARIOUS to see a fake try to troll.
awh you seems to give so much fucks you can't stop your big mouth and insult everyone you talk with.
NOPE, ONLY FAKE ASS PEOPLE LIKE YOU,do you have memory loss?

Cuz I said it A MILLION TIMES YA STUPID ASS FAKE BITCH WITH NO FUCKING LIFE AT ALL! TAKE A KNIFE TO YOUR THROAT AND A GUN TO YOUR FAKE ASS HEAD XDDDDDDD
THIS IS JUST FUN XD

I GUESS YOUR A FAKE ALSO XD
Joncha why do you refuse to actually learn shit
Girls...you're both pretty, stop fighting
Oh how I miss being 13...
because you have nothing to teach you're just a bully
Did you not read it....

IDGAF ABOUT FAKES.
FAKE THINGS DONT MATTER.
REAL THINGS MATTER.

I'd never say anything to someone real, yes I do get bullied, but I don't go online just to bully, I just LOVE talking to fake people, cuz you can say WHATEVER you want, cuz THEYRE NOT REAL.
at least at 13 I wasn't enjoying hurting other for my personal satisfaction. I was a dumb kid, but I wasn't a dumb bully.
And at 13 I was being treated like shit for having tourettes! Wow!
Instead of bashing my personality based on this fucking thread and the fake busters group why don't you to that when you see me directly insult someone on this site?
@joncha...

Insulting a fake like you is literally the same as killing someone in a video game.

IT DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE ITS FAKE.

Yes I do troll fakes for fun, but I'd never do that to a person that was real...

I've said it a million times. 

I DONT CARE BOUT YOU CUZ UR A FAKE
mhmm actually I didn't insulted anyone, I just told that this thread is so wrong and is an exemple of what bullying is. And everyone came to defend it, and you guys started to insult me directly and attack me personaly. So again 3 on 1, I called that bullying again, wich is what you are doing. I didn not insult anyone. You started to call me names so don't play the victim here.
yup agree on that, telling people to kill themselves is wrong on so many level. Since we've started talking on this topic you keep finding excuses for everything, it's justice, we're right! he's only 13. No, it's not how it works. It's not because he's 13 that he has the rights to ask people to kill themself. And same with the rest of you, what you are doing is wrong on so many level, and no matter what sort of excuses you will find there is nothing that can validate what you are doing. You are just an awful person, and a bully. The very fact that you seem to enjoy the pain to inflict show what sort of person you are.
IDGAF ABOUT FAKES GOSH HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT UNTILL YOU DUMBASSES GET THE POINT XD
DUMBASSES
UNTILL
it's until btw, so good job.
and now you are a grammar nazi. How much more annoying can you get...

That quote is the stupidest thing I have ever heard in my whole life. And mate, I have heard alot of stupid shit but this draws the line.
Telling someone to kill themselves REGARDLESS of who they are does MATTER. We are real, we're human like you except we have brain cells.
You CANNOT USE THE EXCUSE "YOU'RE A FAKE" to get away with every single offensive thing you say. For that is not how the world works. Also, fun fact ; if you told a person to kill themselves an exceptional amount of times and they tell you to stop doing it legally they can press charges against you. Odds are, you think you can say anything on the internet and not get in trouble for it. You should introduce yourself to an IP Address if that is the case.
You need to understand there's more to life then telling people to kill themselves then saying they're fakes to try to get away with it. People have emotions you're telling someone to die when you're probably depressed yourself. You need to respect others not hate on them.
Still IDGAF about fakes. Sooooo
I'm just gonna leave it at that.
And we don't give a fuck about you :) and no one should because you're just awful with the things you've said.
Yup. Now go fuck ur self.

OR ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?!?! .
your* 
ok sure
fucking grammar
mhmm
Bleh. No one's focusing on the main point anymore. This thread is dead and nothing good will seem to come from this when I was literally making the best of points. Sigh. I'll join in on the hype of going off topic. Although I do not approve the flame wars going on, I'll go along the tide of going off topic.b0ss said: mhmmYou play Maplestory, congratulations, you're not pathetic. Have you played pre-Big Bang? Back when it was only the five adventurers? Those were the times.

Oh god, anything but "lol so randum xdd"
New here ~
uhm hello. im new and i have no one to talk to
Now everyone can chat with eachother, problem solved.
I don't know what you are tlaking about but from my perspective saying "it's a joke" does not justify anything you could say after.
I'm not racist but... I'm not homophobic but... etc... it was just a joke, it was just a prank. I keep seeing that kind of things on youtube and it's not cool.
I don't agree with that, your actions are what deffine you. If you are a racist, sexist, judgmental person and you try to use your youtube channel to bully people around. Then says oh it was just a joke, you deserve every salty comment you will read after.
You don't seems to understand what I'm saying. Telling you are making a joke doesn't make it OK
If you spread hate around you, you will get hate in return it's just simple as that. Maybe she will learn her lesson.
Well let's hope so. I wish people weren't so butt hurt xD
oh I'm sorry but, I am gay and everytime I keep seeing someone over using the term "that's gay" to point out everything negative. Or calling homosexual a bunch of faggot. I dislike it very much. And then I get called a butthurt after being insulted over and over. No respect for any of that.
I am gay too, and I understand what Kikiroh says and agree with all of it. I think she deserve what is happening to her and it should be a lesson for her.
I've been bullied my whole life for being gay, so I do think it's fair to see some of them being punished.
I dare say, I still find it funny though. :)
She's also a huge liar and generally awful person. Watch GradeAUnderA's videos about her. It'll change your mind quickly.
How many of you guys actually go on Chat?
And how often?
any single guys looking for a bf
They're all single. For a reason. You don't wanna be with any of us.
^^^ Post of the year
boys r dumb thats why im sticking to animals
I want but it's very hard...
Hey everyone! I'm here to say that I do drawings for everybody who asks for one. I do them about every theme that you want, likte a movie, manga, video-game, book whatever. :)
Draw me a demon fox!
you should draw an anime version of meeeeeeee cx plz ;-;
Something random but cool
Like a banana with a shotgun!
How about an aime version of you?
U-MATIC CASSETTE.
I'm with it guys! But now, somebody who talk with? I'm soooooooo bored :'D
Sure. Head over to chat.
can you draw a red and black demon dragon for me o-o
me!! or a fierce dragon!! lol because I love them
GUYS, THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET AROUND TO IT.
cassettes said:
GUYS, THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET AROUND TO IT.
omg draw me !!!
draw me with a tall hot emo guy
So what's the difference between the two?

They all look like weeaboos
I don't know what a weeaboo is exactly but no, that's how cyber goth looks. I know, wild.
^A weeaboo is someone obsessed with Japan/anime to the point where it's all that matters to them and they throw away their own nationality to pretend to be Japanese.

I know that. And those outfits look awfully like an attempt to recreate some weird anime shit.
They really do, honestly
I'm not sure where you get that idea from.. I'm sure stuff like this is frowned upon in Japan and most households. Nothing shown in the pic is Japanese related.
It's not but have you seen harajuku girls
Never heard of it.

They look nothing alike.
Ridiculously colored, oversized clothing.
totaly not alik guise
It isn't.
EXCEPT THEY ARE. THEY'RE SO DAMN SIMILAR.
The attitude?
what do you think about patel goth? I mean.. does it still being goth or not? lol
IMO, pastel goth=soft goth.
Blackwaterfall is a good place to start if you're GENUINELY interested in learning about the different goth cultures, but the artist hasn't posted all of her desciptions on that site. The rest are on her Deviantart, linked below. In response to the Pastel Goth thing, see photo.

SO, FELLAS, THE QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED: IS QUAHOGBS A FAK?
Answer: YES
A'ight
You guys are both fucking retarded.
What are you trolls???
Wtf this quahogbs person is fucking mental
Does he have downsyndrome
Hey quahogbs go fuck off.
again kids reopened the conversation stupid as fuck ketamime xD
Quahog, dont fucking insult my gf, please, im not gonna ask twice, im not gonna repeat it, this thread is done, ignore it.
She's the one who started the thread again with her friends. She's the one who is stupid for doing that. Tell her to stop I,m not gonna ask twice I,m not gonna repeat it.
This thread was done long ago her fault, she's dummy
I mean everytime I log back in I get messages from your stupid girlfriend. Good for her if she like insulting me again and reviving old threads
She hasnt been on for weeks you jackass.
well I got the updates and insults when I came back today so... she's stupid and mean... and so as you... moron
I came around this morning and got 4 or 5 updates from this so yeah... your GF enjoy insulting other it seems.
the salt is real
yup it is... people refuse to let it go xD
Looking for new friends :) people who actually talk and hold conversation, who want to get to know each other better, help each other and always be there for bone another. You interested? Add me and let's chat ^~^
Bored. Someone want to talk?
Hey hi hello, I do.
Like DGD, that is.
LEARN ENGLISH. THEN WE CAN SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
I think your english is crap.
But what they hey, follow your heart only then will you be happy o.O
Exactly couldnt have told that better myself
It's going to get better one day. We've just got to work really hard to accomplish it.
YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT.
thnx hipstercactus & KaeTheSlayer it's good to know that atleast some people agree with me :3
cassettes2 said:

OMG YES DUDE PREACH
Lying is stupid anywayz. I hate fake ppl :P
I don't post pictures of myself really, unless I feel comfortable. But using other people's pictures isn't right either. They should, at least, use a drawing picture or anime. Or like mine, Pon and Zi! xD
But I actually agree with you on this, it is wrong. I don't believe it's right.
And people who use low self-esteem as an excuse for everything, are just ignorant honestly. I'm not trying to be rude to anyone when I say this or anything, but that doesn't give them an excuse to use someone else's picture and claim it's them for a while before openly admitting that it is, in fact, not them.
That is what I think. :)
Honesty is everything, to be honest there would be so many problems prevented if people weren't fake and we're upfront but it's the 'in' thing to be a faker. This world is humiliating
Anyone else who can't go a day without without having John on repeat in their de-socialising ear plug's? Anyone who loves ss, I love you haha :)
I LOVE
:') Awesome! fave song?
Your Call, or Vulnerable.
It actually kinda bothers me though that 90% of people only know Fall For You. ;_;
Wow. I didn't expect such an amazing response speaking of your call I did a mini cover I'm sure you'd appreciate it https://youtu.be/V6yiQc_0SnQ I literally put vulnerable on repeat depends on my mood. Haha the fall for you epidemic I know it well xD
I'll go watch right now. xD
Vulnerable gives me feels idk
I actually don't think I've heard a song of his I didn't like, tbh.
YOU LIKE STATE CHAMPS TOO? 
YOU HAVE A COVER FROM THEM
Thanks XD I get them too especially from half alive aswell. Ikr my heart harmonises with all of john's songs they're amazing ^^ have you heard the naked twist on my story album?

Now you're just putting words into my mouth, mate.
Also you're a chav.
No you're a chav dude and your attitude is what makes it evident by being a keyboard warrior on a website I'm just treating you the way you treat others because I hate bullies.
No, buddy. You say "wog socket". That is almost entirely chav lingo.
I see you have decided I'm a buddy and not a 'mate' now also considered chav lingo XD I just found a friend of mine using it quite funny and I used it. Since when does using a word make you become part of a labeled group anyway? You know because you're into your philosophy :)
WAIT LET ME GO MAKE POPCORN
Here have some of mine I made earlier: *Hands popcorn* :3
Thanks pal. xD

And it's true.
That's your opinion. Lmfao if you think you're gonna upset me you're gonna need to try harder than that. I train with the Sheriff's office, you think you are cool and threatening lmao I've seen 5th graders more intimidating than you. What you're doing is cyber bullying and that's a crime. So if you're gonna troll go somewhere else because I sure wont let you waste any time of mine with that useless crap.
Except I'm neither trying to upset you nor intimidate you.
This is cute and all cassette. But don't you have something better to do?
Nope. Easter holidays soon, thus I've copius amounts of free time.

Kek. Get used to it, you're on a site full of emos. Expect insults.
I do. And I stickup for myself. Thats what I was doing. If I didnt I'd be weak and a cry baby who cuts everytime someone like you guys says this stuff to me.

Usually those who dont respond are called a coward, it can go two ways mate.
That is true, but it still happens.
True. But isn't it better to deal with a couple extra comments after you stop responding rather than continue and become embroiled in a flamewar?
Depends on the situation. Something small like this it doesnt matter.
You both. Neither of you respond please. Drop it.
naw m8 this is fun.
Well. You figure out who your real friends are through conflict I suppose. Starting wars is more eye opening.
you should all grow the fuck up
ITS NOT A PHASE STFU xD :3
For some it's not a phase. But alot of people on here are just bitchy children. Posting things for attention cause they feel special. I wouldn't say all, but i'd say most need to grow the fuck up.
DAMN RIGHT
Who even was this? x'D
Haha. The font isen't necessary bud. But I do get where all these so called "fakes" are coming from. People making fun of and taunting people that actually fake shit for the attention. It's the disgusting truth that people on here bitch too much. Sadly, they will likely never grow out of it and continue to identify as "Emo" because they are too pussy to face life for what it is.
AMEN BROTHA
THE FONT YOU WHORE XD. Nah, jk. Makes mobile reading much easier.
TOUGH SHIT I'M USING A SMALL FONT NOW.
You're the kind of people I get along with XD.

Actually, I know jack shit regarding CSS. That's an issue on your end.

Not everyone on this site watches anime and those of us who do are otakus.
THEY'RE THE SAME FUCKING THING.
"Otaku" literally means geek in Japanese. An otaku watches anime sometimes. A weeaboo breathes anime and Japanese culture (yet seems to think japanese culture is limited to anime). Argue all you want, you're not a living dictionary.

god I miss being 13
Back then you had some degree of an excuse for being edgy.
I was so not edgy at 13. I thought I was better than everyone because I listened to classical music lol. I was kinda like you actually. Also it would be great if you'd quit using the term "edgy" like it's a bad thing. 

              This post was edited by SoleilDormant at February 24, 2016 5:56 PM EST
Edgy is a bad thing, though. Also, no I don't think I'm better than most people. Just you all.
How is it a bad thing exactly? And it's not like we can just decide to not be edgy anymore. I didn't get to choose what kind of music I enjoy or how I like to dress, it just happened. No, you are not better than everyone on this site. But ehhh, whatever helps you sleep at night.
"It's not like we can stop jabbering on about how cool violence and wolves and shit are". You can like it all you want, but when you start going on and on about it, then it becomes a problem.
So what makes others on here better than me? Give me a few examples.
Nothing! Nobody on here is superior to anyone! When will that get through to you? People on here don't think violence is cool, do you really misinterpret everything? Or do you wish it were the case because that just helps your ego? You've said this site is full of boring people, so by logic you'd stop posting and delete your account. It's clear that the only reason you post on this site is because it helps your ego, since you consider yourself superior.
If I had a buck for every 13 year old who thought they were better than everyone on a website/in their school/whatever lol

Ego? I'm not trying to feed my ego. It's just generally speaking, emos tend to have obsessions with violence and the like. Wanna take this over to chat?
Yes, emos did tend to have obsessions with violence. Back in 2008.
But that's the basis of being emo. "Dark" themes, i.e violence and lots of black.
Dark themes don't have to include glorification of violence. And emo is mostly about the music. Macabre is more goths' thing.
Emo, goth, they're all the same.
There was drama on my post and I missed it, woops.
This is regular, doubt it can even be considered drama anymore.
Goth has been around a lot longer than emo. You posted a thread asking for the differences and I took the time to point them out.
The particularly small differences. They're basically the same, exception being Goth clothing isn't whatever cheap crap you can grab at the local Primark.
Basically, the South Park episodes with the goth kids was correct. "Goths tend to think the world is dark and fucked up. But emos think that inside, THEY'RE totally fucked up." The vast majority of goths hate emos.
From what I've observed, these two ideologies are common amongst both goths and emos.
They both look like retards.
Not an appropriate word.
A retard is not something one can look like. You can't look like you're mentally ill.
"Not an appropriate word". Because you're some kind of magical authority on who can say what. Right, yeah, sure.
You got autism or something? It basically means "someone who looks like their mental capabilities are slightly undeveloped" in this context. I don't mean that they have the physical characteristics of a downsy.
No, but I was called a retard throughout middle school because I was shy and terrible at social interaction. I find throwing the term around childish and rude and it should stay in 2008 where it belongs.
Moms spaghetti
My palms r sweaty
Kness weak
Yr mom is heavy
god I miss being 13
Back then you had some degree of an excuse for being edgy.
I was so not edgy at 13. I thought I was better than everyone because I listened to classical music lol. I was kinda like you actually. Also it would be great if you'd quit using the term "edgy" like it's a bad thing.

Edgy is a bad thing, though. Also, no I don't think I'm better than most people. Just you all.
How is it a bad thing exactly? And it's not like we can just decide to not be edgy anymore. I didn't get to choose what kind of music I enjoy or how I like to dress, it just happened. No, you are not better than everyone on this site. But ehhh, whatever helps you sleep at night.
"It's not like we can stop jabbering on about how cool violence and wolves and shit are". You can like it all you want, but when you start going on and on about it, then it becomes a problem.
So what makes others on here better than me? Give me a few examples.
Nothing! Nobody on here is superior to anyone! When will that get through to you? People on here don't think violence is cool, do you really misinterpret everything? Or do you wish it were the case because that just helps your ego? You've said this site is full of boring people, so by logic you'd stop posting and delete your account. It's clear that the only reason you post on this site is because it helps your ego, since you consider yourself superior.

If you think they look ridiculous, you say they look ridiculous, not that they look like retards. Retarded is not a synonym for shitty.
Still trying to police what others say.
Okay, "ridiculous" it is.
I'm not trying to police. You have the right to say it and I have the right to tell you it's a derogatory term. It's like calling random things gay.
Sure, sure.
I'd like to think that you're worth my time But you embody everything that I hate Take a good hard look at what you see I've lost all my hope and all my faith Cause when I barely fuck up you just recoil and weep What do you want from me? I'm just a kid who got in too deep My walls are built up high forever bound to be steep I've got a birds eye view of all the secrets you keep.

this thread just got raped by this asshole advertising his shit on here ;-;
I suck and I am dumb
A lonely guy looking for fun
Just a loser who is in constant despair
Drink till its numb
I accept the fact. She is gone
Life unfair, mine is spared
To relive the nightmare
But noone cares
Only her but she is gone
I fucking miss her.
I wish she was here
I must see her again
Even if I have to cross over

I found my dream but she died and is burning in hell
And I hope one day. I can lift her heavy spell
I showed her love and I hope it is cherished
I gave it all I got 
But it all went in vein. I love her. I miss her. And everything that was worth living died with her

Yeaa.. I like it real sllooow, I like it real bad. Id like to get myself together
And love, to hear you get undress
In your way, just be quiet, follow pain and bleed
Yell or wale, and if I sigh, stake me how the tv
If I may, I might, gonna go and bleed
It's pretty to see 
How much you will bleed 
For me
It's nice to know
How much you will throw 
for me 
I'm just a little thing 
I don't know whats there to bring
Just a hangover and a show
My addiction comes and grows

My Love is pure seduction
 reality gets hard to function 
On your mind everyday 
You find me hard to stay away

Your the fool and im your queen
and one day you'll be my king 
Just pour your lonely heart onto me
Try your best and let your love sing

Your whole world comes crashing down
Hold me tight and make no sound
The monsters walk among  and steal 
Never again to be -two face
Feels so good when your crossing down the street and you don't give a shit if you make it all the way
Hurts so good when you like a girl, who sweeps you off your feet but she don't give a shit on what you gotta say
Cause it feels so good
How it hurts so good
How everybody just never understood
They'll never get my pain
They'll never see me sane
They'll only see that im just another stain
She sucked out all the fun
I have nowhere left to run
I wish my life was over but life has just begun
TWOFACE said: They'll never get my pain They'll never see me sane They'll only see that im just another stain She sucked out all the fun I have nowhere left to run I wish my life was over but life has just begun
Life has just begun, yet we'er always on the run
They say that life is fun, but the truth holds all our fear
The end is nearly here, let us take it by it's roots and forever disappear
can't think of any topics so just message me :p
Sure thing
I like your face

hey guys! i need some help on what youtube videos i should make! please give me ideas if you have any! 
hmm well, do it about art or music I guess
Just make local pranks, or maybe pull some dick move and like chuck eggs at random ass people in the hood :D .Just an idea being pitched out there :3
sing for all of us kass
Um maybe do one on Emowire, so you can help those who don't know about it, after all 1000 people does not sound that big, but then again this site might have a bunch of "fakes", IDK, MAYBE SING THAT'S POPULAR, or dye your hair, make up. Piercing reviews, colors, poetry, anything, Go Youtube, I am saying all this and I have no idea what youtube videos you have made, cause I dont know your channel, oh man. I hope this helped and didn't hinder your ideas, if it did sorry. 
P.s. You can always do another video as you were a cat, which was funnycute.

Sociopath or Psychopath? Which do you reside under ot are you both. Just wanna know I am a tad psychopathic. Hah. Just know to be psycho. Doesn't mean you necessarily act on it. You just think morbid things.
^^^ That post.
And regardless, I'm neither. I function perfectly.
Valid point but like being something inside can be different and I know a lot of sociopaths that converse online. I wasn't trying to offend anyone.I'm real sorry if I did I just like to know opinion s. And being a psychopath do sent necesarilly mean they are violent or they mutilate. They can be any number of things I lay in a fine in between. To where I have thoughts but not many actions. So if I offended you I'm sorry I was curious is all and I'm actually glad that you shared your opinion .
It's not an opinion, it's psychology. What you describe isn't psychotic at all, it's a little weird, but in a completely average way. The fact that you just apologized multiple times just proves my point that you're not a psychopath. Psychopaths usually don't feel remorse or empathy, they don't care about other people aside from themselves. You just implied that you care about my opinion and apologized in case you hurt my feelings so that obviously doesn't apply to you. 

In addition, are the people you've spoken to self diagnosed? If they are, I'm sure that they were either lying, or misidentified some other underlying disorder. You can't just diagnose yourself with disorders because you have some slight idea that it might be true, because there are hundreds of mental and emotional disorders that have VERY similar symptoms, or others where the symptoms are very glamorized and influenced by rumours (ie. Schizophrenia and psychosis. Unless you've actively studied the brain, I can almost guarantee what you know about both is incorrect because of the spread of misinformation) 

I've been studying psychology and the brain for three years, and trust me, you're not a psychopath. No matter how much you think intrusive thoughts make you a psychopath, it doesn't. The legal definition of psychopaths include mutilation and violent tendencies, which you said you don't have.
^ I agree with Adrienne. I don't understand the deal with teenagers wanting to be psychopaths and being so quick to diagnose themselves.
It's such a fad in this decade to self-diagnose. I feel like people want to collect disorders like trophies and show them off as if they're collectables. I've been professionally diagnosed with a number of disorders and difficiencies and I find it insulting when people romanticize them as if it's a good thing or as though it, god forbid, makes them "special". 

People who self-diagnose themselves with disorders, even worse is without researching, are the reason that the older generations think that  people in their teens and 20s are constantly exaggerating and flaunting their problems. Bit by bit disorders aren't going to be taken seriously anymore, and that's the real problem.
I couldn't have said it better
I'd just like to emphasize on the fact that one of the biggest problems with the opening topic is that she said "Doesn't mean you necessarily act on it. You just think morbid things." 
If every person that thought about something morbid was labeled as a psychopath, it'd be a regular occurrence in our society. I really want to put it out there that intrusive thoughts (that includes sudden thoughts of stabbing the person you're sitting beside for no reason) does NOT make you a psychopath. 
Intrusive thoughts are randomly occurring, usually malicious in nature or obviously stupid ideas, but never acted upon. This includes everything from wanting to put your hand on a hot burner, to wanting to lash out and punch someone. 
The psychopathic element would be acting upon it, or being unable to realize that it's morally wrong. If you've never stabbed someone out of random chance, or if you know stabbing someone is bad, congratulations. You've proven that you are not a psychopath.
i see morbid things and fix morbid things the people who act on such emotions perform.
Ok. Tbh I'm sorry for this like I didn't mean to um upset you? Just a question I'm glad you told me tho. K. Um Yesh.
You didn't upset me, I'm just telling you that you have your labels wrong
i tend to agree with mizz beck

Snatched the idea from the "Would you rather forum" but instead of giving them 2 choices, why not give them a million dollars, for a yes or no question.So the format is,Answer the question aboveAsk a "Would you (insert question) for a million dollars?"Then keep it alive?If the topic doesn't go anywheres then it's fine.But without further explination I'll start.Would you have sex with a family member (any-related type, such as step-family and cousins and whatnot) for $1,000,000?
yeah, i dont know my real family so it really wouldnt be all that weird cuase, i dont know them :) just like any raandom peson off the street.
yeah, i dont know my real family so it really wouldnt be all that weird cuase, i dont know them :) just like any raandom peson off the street.
if i can choose which one than yea
i used to have the hottest 2nd cousin in my teens, a few beers id have done it or a $1 haha
I'm just going to ask a question to keep this alive.Would you participate in one of Saw's games for a million dosh?
(Bearing in mind that the choices you have to make include some of his worse traps, for example you have to fill a bucket with 8 pints of blood in order to escape a room and you'd do so by cutting parts of your body off to fill the bucket. Or, you have friends and family on a rotating carousel with a shotgun attached to one end and you have to decide who to save but the others have to die etc.)
Um. Probably not like if it was just killing other people maybe. But me nawp. That sounds bad Ik. But like I'd rather not die so gruesomley for one million dollars. It would be a waste if time cause I may not even live.
Yeah no. Not saw's games.
Would you kill a close friend for million bucks?
would you solve the p vs np problem for 1,000,000 dollars?
would you kill your family for a million dollars
my dad gladly the rest of them nah
would you believe in the direct oposit religion for a million dollars?

Hey you yes you. Your amazing. I might not know you but I know that everyone is amazing, beautiful and perfect in their own way. You might say i have flaws I say love we all got flaws. You might say I make mistakes I say dear we all make mistakes. When you think about taking up a razor to cut, remember this wrists are for bracelets not cutting AND your to beautiful to have scars and I care and love ya. Keep your chin up cuz tomorrow is a different day. Love you all keep strong 
:)
well put, I have flaws and alot of them are mental scars unhealed. But still I get by with a smile and my friends and family keep me going :)
Awww good 
:D indeed, if I have a reason to keep going and smiling I know my scars "depression and other such" will not be as apparent
That's good hun 
I am here for ya if you need to talk or what not
I thank you, Though I am normally not one to confer my feelings and issues with to others, but should I need a lending ear I am more than all to happy to oblige and convey my issues of apathy or animosity.
If you guys need any help, message me that you want to talk to someone and I'll give you my kik ^_^
That's nice, but I'm not particularly fooled by you trying to address me, personally, in this post. Or, attempting to give such an impression, anyway.
For all you know I could be a mental institution escapee tearing people's flesh out with my teeth as we speak. Would that be "Amazing" or "Beautiful"? And, while I am far from that, you still know very little about me and are not in a position to define me as such.

This topic is for you anime people. My personal favourite anime is the Dragon ball series.. what is yours?? and what is even your worst?
I already made a topic on this...
I musn't have seen it :l .. Now I have too
As a kid I found Sailor Moon one of my favorites...
Then Card Captors...
Right now the decision is too tough with all new animes coming out and some that were good but never finished, like Zach Bell...
Asking for just one favorite is far too difficult...
At the moment my most favorite and first and always has been Black Cat. I must have seen it a thousand times. My least favorite? Naruto I mean mean I was interested at first but then I lost my way. I feel guilty. Another one is Bleach mostly for the fillers But I wouldn't mind watching it all over again. I still like it it's just taking forever to end is the problem :)
Mines Naruto I've been watching this since I was a little kid, and I find it awesome,but I also love many more anime so manyI don't think I'b be able to list them all here lol
Hard to say, I've seen so many but a few would be Blood+, Durarara, The World God Only Knows and Death Note.
Psycho Pass is one of my favorites but i also really like Attack on Titan. BTW they just added a new ova for Attack on Titan. I also really like Black Butler.
Mine is Fairy tale and Black butler..
FAIRYTALE:Lucy and Natsu
BLACKBUTLER:Sebastian
Angel Beats (Favorite)
Least Favorite: Let me get back to you on that
I love InuYasha and Panty and Stocking With Gater Belt xD also Deathnote, Fairy Tale, Asobi Ni Iku Yo, Inu x Boku, Card Captor Sakura, Tsubasa Chronicles, XXX Holic, The Devil Is A Part Timer, Is This A Zombie, WitchBlade... haha umm. I wtch a lot of anime .-.
I'm watching Devil is a part timer right now, OMG it is so funny.
.
Sword Art Online (FAVE!!!), Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Deadman Wonderland. About to start Attack on Titan and see what all the hype is about.

Definitely Attack on Titan :)
Clash of titans
Sao and dead man wonderland
Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Bodacious Space Pirates.
Blood+ would have to be my favorite

The worst for me, any mech anime -_-
Black Butler
Watamote! And another too cx
my favourite animes are dragon ball, dbz, dragon ball gt, date a live, Rosario + vampire, shuffled, dearS. If anyone wants to talk to me then feel free to message me when you have the time.
Chrono's Crusade, Yu Yu Hakasho, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, Mushi-Shi, and Full Metal Alchemist/Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood all have great storylines.

Dragon Ball GT doesn't exist.
Dragon ball gt does exist because i have watched from start to finish, if u don't believe me then go onto kissanime.com and type up dragon ball gt and it will be there.
ive alwayz luved inuyasha its my most favss
My favorite anime list is just too long... One of my favorites from the list would be Black Lagoon

Mine has to be Bleach
Mine has to be Akame Ga Kill. I like how it's entertaining by employing the "monster of the week" type thing

Rip part by limb by limb. Cut away what is left. You won the battle, but will you win the war. You push me down so I won't get back up. Trying to break the walls of inscurity with the brick of self control. Nothing works all hope is gone. I wasn't suppose to live, he took away the gun. And hit me till I bleed. Pain is all the world knows..Better to numb than to feel..

how do i tell her im just being myself
tell her that we all can't really explain why we are attracted/interested into certain things. We are all different. We can't control what you like to wear and our interests. be proud of yourself for being yourself. doesn't matter what others think 
I've been emo since I was 14

I'm almost 20

its not a phase
Couldnt agree more guys. My mum has took my bvb poster down and im crying inside. Does she not understand ??
I don't think many adults these days understand emo to be honest. I mean, I'm 21 and it's definitely not a phase for me. My brother is a few years older than I am and he doesn't understand it. I think it has to do with what generation you're from. The older generation, like my family, just don't understand. Just be who you feel you truly are. If you saw me around my family and on Facebook you'd think I was a goody two shoes, but who I truly am is the person on this site. I've learned how to live 2 lives, one for my family, then the true one for me. You'll find a way to settle things out, just hang in there :)
hey
I can tell you, with experience: IT'S A FUCKING PHASE. You won't accept it right now, but once you hit the age of about 25, you'll realize it was a phase and an attempt to look cool, and you'll laugh at the good days.

Yay this is so fun xD

When the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of gold...

What would you do? somthing normal somthing crazy?
Probably not a whole lot of anything. I had one once. I didn't really like it.
lol last week my friend's fridge stopped working and all of the klondike bars he had bought were pretty much melted. I freaked out because I had been craving and expecting a klondike bar and so I refroze one and tried to eat it. It was absolutely terrible. :/
im with petrova lol
I've never had a klondike bar...
What wouldn't I do for a klondike bar?

Everyone has their own unsecurities. I've been on this site even before the site crashed in March, and I've seen a lot of people here although I've never had people messaging/commenting/posting about triggering topics like selfharm, drugs, ect. That's saying something, i have a lot of friends on this site.
No. I mean, if you say someone is /ugly/ they cry that you're triggering them. That's what I don't get. So what if someone thinks you're ugly or fat. People online shouldn't hold any meaning on how you view yourself. Lol.
Well for a start you shouldn't be saying that people are ugly or fat at all, that's just flat out horrible, and no wonder people get upset when people say things like that to them. If you're in a position of high insecurity, then you're most likely going to take those comments to heart - the answer is not to talk shit to people full stop.
I understand that people need to get used to it but I don't see why they should have to put up with it, especially on the internet. People make rash judgements about others and don't care about the actual emotions of the other person. Nevertheless, I still think that there's absolutely no excuse for stupid comments like fat/ugly etc - sure, people need to have the knowledge that the world isn't "sunshine and rainbows" but do you really think that the best way to teach them is through insulting them before telling them to get over it?
I get your point, however what you have described is effectively cyber-bullying. I also see how there are other issues which can be prioritised, but in the meantime, how about making the smaller-scale differences such as trying to help these people? As I said before, some people are just naturally sensitive and they require more of a coping mechanism to deal with insults. Many of these people may have depression, may be heavily bullied already or simply have great insecurities, and this isn't uncommon considering the "perfection" portrayed in the media these days.
Words are more powerful to some than those who spoke them intended and people have to realise this - keep in mind that people don't appreciated being insulted - it's a social given.
Priorities are key. People don't think the owrld is nice, people actually think the opposite, but then comes in mental priorities. EX- Janet thinks that the world problems are horrid, but she also HATES it when she's insulted. ~ Janet's priorities are different. Yours might be worrying about the world, but Janet is worrying about herself. That might sound bad, but she could be dealing with some shit.
Tbh. We're never gonna agree. I think people should get thicker skin, and you guys think it's okay to cry they're being /triggered/
Personally, orchid, or whatever your real name is, I think that you've been taught how to deal with shit like being associated with isis, or any other insult that people can come up with regarding middle eastern people. But being able to protect yourself from that kind of hurt is something learned. People aren't born being able to protect themselves. Like for instace, I used to trigger really badly from what people said to or about me online. Now, I don't trigger from shit online, but sometimes I get triggered irl because of something someone said. Or like, I feel guilty because I talk to people about my problems and other people have their own shit, sometimes worse than my own, and that just makes me feel worse, that I'm complaining. It's a developed skill. You don't just have it. Yes, some people should "grow thicker skin" but growing that skin requires a complete change in your lifestyle, environment, everything. I would know. I'm not advocating being an attention whore, but you can't really control what gets to you and what doesn't. Yes, you can control what you do, but what if you've never been shown another way to deal with sometihing? Triggering is a delicate topic in the sense that it's not something that should be encouraged, but people need to learn how to get over themselves, so yes, you're going to have to face a little pain to build up your callous. But that's something that should be done irl. Not online, because there might not be someone there irl to stop the person if you push them too far without realizing it.
I think everything thats been said here is pretty lame.
:'/ you disappeared again....
It's gonna stay that way too. I don't want to talk to anyone anymore
Alright. I miss you, though...
Save it. I don't care
what did I do?

Hey

So my friend and I today had a conversation about mental health and depression in young people and it later developed into the idea that we could set up a charity to raise awareness and funds for the treatment of teenage depression. It is something we both feel very strongly about as I know so many people (including myself) who have been through some rough times with mental health. I was wondering if anybody had any stories to share? (Although we know this area fairly well, it would be nice to hear some of your stories and perhaps any ideas for what we could do with the funds to help people)?
I think that's a great idea..I struggle with multiple anxiety disorders and depression so I get where you're coming from. I had a terrible morning with it actually couldn't stop shaking but I think it'd be beneficial for people to know things like that so they'd stop taking it as a joke.
I'm sorry to hear that :/ I agree though, I'd really like to raise awareness for it because there's a stigma surrounding the subject where people don't really understand it because it's not a physical illness so there is often no visible "proof" as such - I'd just want to help to get rid of the stigma really
Exactly, I tried to persuade somebody that it's a good cause but they were ignorant of the fact that it's a legitimate problem. It definitely needs more awareness
Ive been officialy diagnosed with deppression and anxiety for a year now, i have days just like you guys and my nights can be just as worse as the next person, but unlike you guys i was born with cerebal palsy on the left side of my body and this has played on me throuout my life, been judged and victimised because of it, also find it next to impossible to interact with other people as my anxiety kicks in, could probs go on forever about my accumulated miseries and misfortune but thats another story, empathy makes everything a bit less shit

I think this is a great idea. Work to try to spread awareness. You could focus on depression/suicide in young adults. I don't really know how you would go about using the funds. maybe make a website?
Thank you, hopefully it'll work :)
I found people on the internet and my therapist were the most helpful people. Doctors either made me feel like they thought i was faking it or that they were keeping me on the drugs for my money.
I think it's awesome to raise awareness to this. I'm depressed and suicidal myself. It's hard to let people see it's not something that just goes away like a cold. I often get responses like: "it's just a fase", "everyone feels like that once in their life", stuff like that. But it's not. It's not just a fase. It might be true that everyone has it once in their lives, but that doesn't make it less serious.
Just wondering if anyone else plays Pokemon X/Y or ORAS ^^ It'd be nice to be able to add a couple new friends to trade/battle with.
I have Pokemon X. :) My 3DS Friend Code is 3067-4849-3880.
Awesome :) I added you.
I play X/Y and ORAS
Favorite band? and why?
I'll have to say Black Veil Brides and A Static Lullaby. Probably because their lyrics have so much thought and meaning in them. They also have great emotion in them, unlike a lot of music nowadays.
Alesana or S3rl. They both help me focus while I'm drawing.
My friends dont talk to me much and i wanted someone to talk to and someone i can trust. message me on here if your interested.

Poor you. :( talk to me if you want.
It work if ye both want it so. Never did it but wish you both best luck
thanks :)
There are ways to contribute to the mutual functionality of a long distance relationship. I can relate to how you feel, but as a matter of fact it can work out very well if you communicate, go slow(moderate speed), and if you are ok with not being able to see them.

Just curious what other people think. I know the majority of people on this site are teenages and I haven't run across many people who are 21 (I'm 21 by the way). Is there really an age limit? I've had people tell me I need to grow up and grow out of this but it's who I am and I don't see how you can really grow out of who you are. Just curious what you guys think :)
nope
That's good to know. I don't like pissing people off so hopefully I should be good to go.
i'm almost 20. people closer to our age saw emo from the beggining and before emo existed xD but in my opinion there is no age limit really :/ i'm not changing again.
I'm right there with you Dylan. Changing again is not in my book. Glad to know there are others out there close to my age.
I'm 21 as well. There are times where there's a maturity difference but other than that, it's not too old..but maybe I'm just biased;) haha
Pfff 21, I wish I could be 21 xD
wish i was 16 again. i hate the day i turned 18 :(
IM ABOUT TO BE 18 AND IM WORRIED FOR MY INNER CHILD'S WELL BEING
mine died a long time ago :( now i'm an empty pit of thoughts, feelings and energy.
Sorry to hear that. I just try and make the most of everything I got
so have i but no matter what i do it's not enough. it's really been eating me up inside especially since after all the work i put in i have nothing.
I wish I could go back and live it differently but I'm sure everyone feels that eventually. I just don't see many emo's my age where I live and it just kinda made me wonder. And AcrylicDye, keep your inner child alive at all costs!!! :P it helps later in life.
there were skaters, emo's and scenes all over where i live but cops didnt like us then them and preps started to overrun the city xD now it's rare to see skaters, scenes, emo's or anything close to that category.
21
Im 20 and im openly emo/scene/ goth or whatever ibdont censor my mouth or think before i talk if anyone hates what i say do or am i tell them to feel free to suck my dick and get over themselves cuz life isnt about what other people think i openly talk about my issues and people get use to it im as obscene as they get but oh well that's just me so just do you and don't mind what others say or think
I completely understand putting up a front for work. I'm currently taking a course to become a certified nursing assistant and we have to wear all white scrubs. Obviously I won't be dressing like I normally do for work. I just mean outside of it in my personal life away from work. I've had people say it's all just a phase or that I need to grow up and stop dressing and being the person I am. Personally I don't think there's an age limit when it comes to our personal lives, but it's certainly a topic that people have brought before me.
It's not a phase by any means
Glad to hear someone else say that!
Nope, age is just a number.

I'll be working as a correctional officer in a few months (possibly this coming year), I'll have to wear a uniform and cut my hair (currently have it at medium length), I don't mind spiking my hair, as long as I can style it, I'll be fine. On the means of how I dress, I'll have my skinny jeans and what not for outside of work, obviously.

I seriously love hearing that we're never too old :3 Hearing that you need to "Grow out of it" starts to hurt after a while.
My mom keeps telling me that I'll eventually grow out of it and honestly - maybe I will.
Though until then.
I'm living my life how I feel comfortable.
It's not a phase in my eyes and others should understand that.
Hell no. 21 is not too old I say if ur comfortable ur cool piss too many off we show it

What brought you to this site?
I was searching online for emo social networks. This was the first one I found that hadn't been dead since 2008.
Last year, a former friend recommended it to me since I wanted to find a new social network.
I thought I would fit in more with the misfits.. but im starting to think im just a boring person xp
Looking for a place to fit in.
boredom, interwebs, go figure

Yep, it is. I doubt it'll catch on, to be honest. Very few defining features; there are many more websites pretty much the same as this.
Time for a new website. lol. Ill make one

my mom controls my life...she wont let me wear black eyeliner/eyeshadow...she wont let me dye my hair teal even though its mostly teal...she wont let me go to the gas station by myself...she hates my music...i just dont see what i did wrong..im perfectly old enough to go places..im 14 for petes sake!! im going to be in 9th grade...i dont see whats the big issue...ive run out of things to do... please...help me....
like i legit dont know what to say/do anymore...i just am really pissed by how much she controls my life.
I think you should wait a bit. She'll come around. TBH you ARE 14, that's kind of young to be prancing along in public since there are some sick old dudes out there. The hair and makeup I can help you. Just tell her the dye washes out in a week or two (because it does, at least Manic Panic does.) The makeup for me was just walk out of the house like that...my mom didn't accept it but then she grew into it so start light on the eyeliner then just grow from there. The music might be harder, considering you might be into other stuff. Just show her Indie Foster the People songs or the slow Nirvana songs because those she might actually not be a dick about.
she likes nirvana...she hates screamo...she wont let me get the makeup...she wont consider letting me dye my hair.....the gas station is only half a block from where i live...and im moving to a townhouse thats even closer to it.
Then I don't know what to do...that's all I can help you with.
Then I don't know what to do...that's all I can help you with.
thanks for trying to help.
I do vocals mostly for a once Industrial Aggrotech band, drums and keyboard
I play saxaphone. 'Cause why not. But I wanna play bass guitar.
I play drums, guitar, and keyboard. I'd like to learn violin. I used to be in a band but it didn't really work out. I have an electric and acoustic guitar but had to sell my drumset a little while ago. I really play all kinds of music. I play the keyboard more than anything now. I don't go to too many concerts but I have seen bring me the horizon, imagine dragons, small bands at the masquerade and macklemore.
piano and acustic guitar and banjo i fthat counts
My Vocal Chords :D, Guitar, and Piano. I'm a solo-artist, making it a 'carreer' of personal self-expression. If others appreciate, I appareciate. I've tried collaborating with another person before, just a friend and not really an acquainted artist, and thaaat.. Totally didn't work out. Having a band would be so fucking cool. I play lots of shit.. I'd say mostly however indie/folk as I looovee my acoustic guitar and my favourite artist is Conor Oberst, so, I play a lot of his music which is within that genre : ). Essentially I play music with lyrics that mean a lot to me. As I feel every artist should. I've been a street performer for the past months, especially in the Winter. Which is just bein' a "street musician"... those instances have been my only 'gigs' ; )
I play drums and guitar and sing. I'm in a band with a couple of my friends and it's going pretty well c: we might get signed soon.
Clarinet & Harmonica
Sometimes :]
Mother made me learn clarinet and I chose harmonica because... It's beautiful! :D
Clarinet most of the time & always enjoy the harmonica ^_^
It's boring and kind of hard actually... And you kinda have to follow what's on the paper... Can't just like... Jam you know? :'D
Orchestral... Blues, blue grass, Rock and roll ^_^
The woodwind group I play with are always doing concerts and things like at christmas and old folks homes... The other band I'm in, the cool one :D We play in a couple of pubs and this underground smokey blues bar Alex found ^_^ It's so cool! :D ....Mother doesn't actually know about it....

Tenor sax, all the way! My dad played it so i was like, hey,why not? I don't want to buy a new instrument when i go into band. (Band is like the cool thing where i live so i wanted to be cool then but now I'm just a band geek) Yeah so, tenor power! Also a bit of piano and i wish to learn guitar. I play in the jazz band, we play old rock songs sometimes too. I also just love music in general so yeah, band.
i play the drums, im in my school band nothing great haha i play it cause i enjoy it and its the only instrument i find to enjoy after trying multiple insurments. i love playing it cause its unique (apparently for a girl) i do school preformances with percussion and bands and orchestras (i dont like orchestra as its like simple) :)
My life is really bad right now and I just need someone to be there for me
Im here if u need help
otayyy

Elllo been here a while but umm... im shy too
Ello im new here too and shy too cant stand and speek lot of English but im good at typing it so ya just hit me up if u need anything
I'm kinda new here. I've been a member for about a month and have only visited twice, I'm mostly on Facebook or Messenger. If you want to message me, my name is Dami Adams, user is Dami.reaper. 

There's not a lot that you NEED to know about me. I'm pretty easygoing. I like writing stories, poems, and songs, reading, or listening to music in my free time. I listen to everything and I read a lot of horror. Horror movies also get me going, 

I'm single, but I'm only here to make friends. I don't really care for relationships. I prefer  to be single and just flirt around honestly. I don't have the time or patience for failed relationships. 

I want to become a writer someday and travel the world. Other than that, I want to start my own family. 

You know a bit about me now, so just shoot me a message I guess. Don't be boring and don't be cliche. Peace xx
I feel you on the realationship stuff. Flirting is way to fun to quit. Not that anybody flirts with me.

Hello! My name is Emilio and I just turned 20, I live in Sweden and I'm studying to become a kindergarten teacher.I am straight, a gemini & I do unclean vocals.I'm not sure how to introduce myself in an interesting way, so I'm really sorry if my introductions is flat.I am here to find people to talk to, and I'd really prefer talking over kik/snapchat than here.Some of the bands I like are:Woe, Is Me, Sylar, Memphis May Fire, We Are Harlot, Isles & Glaciers, Jonny Craig, Issues, Upon A Burning Body, The Bad Chapter, I Am Abomination, Beartooth, BlackbearMy music taste doesn't really stop there. I listen to all kinds of music, but I guess these bands are the relevant ones.Some of the shows I like:Pokemon, Entourage, Community, Family Guy, Dexter, Lost, Californication, South ParkIf you're wondering anything else, just write to me & I'll do my best to answer everyone.Hope you all have a great day, ciao.
Hello cx
Oh hi my name is Shane from Texas. I have joined this site cause I'm very lonely and need a friend in my life. I am 17 years old and my favorite bands are Fall Out Boy, Sleeping with Sirens, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots, Blood On The Dance Floor, and of course Black Veil Brides the band that saved my life :D lol.
No wonder you're lonely, your tastes in music are shit and you say "Rawr" spontaneously.
Oh wow that exactly the opposite I wanted out of this, good job you just added another cut. And Black Veil Brides got me to wear I am today and has taught me a lot and made me consider not suicide
You needed Black Veil Brides to get you out of suicide? That's fucking pathetic, man.
This isn't how I wanted it to be at all, you guys are really triggering me
Also if you talk about Blood on the Dancefloor on this site, don't get offended when I tell you about all the horrible shit Dahvie Vanity's done. Calling him out is something I love to do, mostly because he's not in jail yet. It's a shame to still be a BOTDF fan at 17, honestly.

Im 18 from Indiana. Im just looking for some cool friends to gain!
Or, Bullet, just listen to some fucking Brand X.
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
Hi BlackBlade ^_^ Hope you're doing well :3
Look at this garbage. THIS is what you are supporting. This is the man you call your hero. I need to you think real hard about what it is you see in him.



Don't tell me how to live my life faggots. Dahvie is a great inspiring guy
Nothing about him is inspiring, he's a bully. But hey, don't say I didn't warn you when you're at a BOTDF meet & greet, being forced to give Dahvie head in the back of their tour bus.
"better person" This person is calling me a faggot for being honest and caring about them lol they're not a "better person"
Look ,I know what he called you but you really can't change his opinion.I'm not taking any sides but ...how can I say this? That's his opinion and we can't make him replace it with ours if he doesn't want to.
I really am trying to think of things about Dahvie that might be positive; but it's clear that the only reason emo and scene kids like the guy is because he defends them and says it's okay to be "different". Then to the people who aren't "different" and call him out on his bullshit? "I would love to push you down the stairs you cunt brick!". So inspirational right?

It's not ,I know.I've discovered Dahvie and BOTDF when I was 15-16.I know that he isn't a sensitive person and I know that he's rude towards people.
I agree that few of the songs that he has are pretty funny but if I have to fully agree on something with Shane is about Black Veil Brides because Andy really is an ispiration.At least that's my opinion.
I personally like their music, not a big fan of them. But who cares, becuase its all about the music so everyone shush 
What kind of films do you like?^-^
I like sci-if to ^-^

Hi gaynigga :D
hello :D
bro go sip lean
i bet thatll help
Hey there peoples. Name's Jack and I mostly came here to read any interesting perspectives. Being an introvert my whole life has led me down a relatively strange path. Everyday filled with self-analysis, my view of our reality has gotten to a point where I'm not sure if it can change anymore. So I plan to pan through and see if I find any interesting minds.

Hello! =3
Fuck off filthy nigger
hey therand welcome
hi :D
Hey I'm Brandy! Nice to meet you! I'm looking for friends and people to chat with. I love anime and uh... horror stuff I guess.
You show no dominance, what a faggot.
I'm not a pile of sticks, thank you very much. But yes, I am gay. Thank you for pointing that out. Have a wondrful day!
Pans tho...pussy.
Did I say you had a pussy? No, I called you one. Stop trying to act smart when your shit doesn't even make sense. Another "unsure" 18 year old. Faggot is a durragatory term towards people like you. You act stupid, I'll treat you like you are. Fuck outta here.
That's not very nice nor mature. And I will not. You do not control me. I control myself. I am a boxer. I take care of myself. Now please leave me alone, sir.
How is it less mature than acting like an idiotic child? Who cares if you're a boxer? Isn't that a poor white man's sport? And taking care of yourself by losing fights and getting your ass kicked...right. VERY smart. Also, your sentence structure in itself tells me you don't take care of your mental health. I'm not controlling you, I'm treating you a certain way. So, maybe think a little next time, big man.
I do have schizophrenia and autism, my good sir. I don't get my ass kicked because I don't do competion. I only fight if I have to protect myself. So please stop treating me the way yoy do because it's not very mature or affective, as it does not make me concerned. I reported and blocked you. Please leave me alone now, because I have more improtant buiseness that talking with an imature brat like you.
Autism is obvious, your intense paranoia shows you're more unstable. Hope the Psych ward is having a sale, bc bitches like you needa be put away or put down. You aren't really a boxer if all you do is "fight". Do you hit with your wrist? Like normal kids with autism do? Autism doesn't compensate for your poor english. How am i being immature? I'm just being honest, pal.

This isn't you dude. Back off,
I remember when it was against the site rules to use photos of other members.
well it's a picture I've found out on google
Not yours though. It's on Google because the original owner of the photo uses Instagram, photos from Instagram and or MySpace are shared on Google as well, so of course you will find it there.
it's actually a very old picture that is on internet so stop making a whole bunch of unnecessary drama about it, there is no owner of that picture since it's unrightful from google
Dude just go. This isn't you. Give it up.
Pictures shared on Instagram are leaked to Google, your lies fall on def ears.
never said it was me I just thought I liked the picture on google that's all xD
I don't think it's his picture either lol it was an old thing that is on google
anyho if he's really mad about it he can send me a memo we'll solve that in a civilized manner
ohh well from the site I picked it I think it was posted 2 years ago but I don't have the memory of numbers so idk it's just an approximation.
and if it's really really really his picture well I'm going to switch my picture for Ron Jeremy. I think you guys should relax and take a deep breath I think you just took the thing a bit too seriously.
if I'm breaking the site rules then he is too mostly xD
Nope, just you.
then you are also breaking the rule
We've had some ass on here faking well known members and it's been kind of irritating. So you stop saying to relax and just change the damn picture, and this will be done.

Hi, I'm Bella. Some of you may know me, but I highly doubt it. I was a former member back in 2012, but lost my account for reasons unknown. But I'm back. I'm not that good at describing myself, but I'm a shy monkey and I love music. In other words, if you love music and bands: we're best friends right from the start.

Hey, everyone. The name is Haniel, but I'm not exactly an emo type. Oh well, who cares? I'm just looking for someone, well... EMO. (Duh.) Maybe they might care for what I say instead of stab me in the back... I can only express my feelings in writing, but they can be pretty deep if you admire me. Well, that's about it for me. Maybe I can find a nice girl around here...

Isn't it a public danger to drive when your bangs cover 70% of your face
And why don't you respect people who self harm? It's a mental illness, an impulse they can't help. People not taking them seriously is the reason it's hard for them to get help.
i'm not stupid enough to drive with my hair in my face. and i dont because i want to have nothing to do with them. thats my choice. i don't care for them and many of them don't bother looking for help and are just attention seeking. i apologize for the late reply however, i dont get updates on mobile.
and i wasn't driving in my pfp, i was with a friend.
Hey I'm new here, wanna make some friends :)
Sup fam my names Bryan
Hey my name's Mandy, I'm emo and love music. I'm new here and looking for some friends

Whats up c:

Hello Friend ^^ nice machete you're holding there.

Hi people! c:
Welcome
I'm new too
I deleted my account a couple times, but now I'm back to stay!

for those of you who are new to me, here's my introduction

About me umm......I'm 19 years old but act  like a preteen still X,3 due to my autism. I'm a musician as well, I specialize in Nintendocore and Chiptune. I'm an otaku, brony, furry, you name it! X3 my favorite bands include BVB, ISHTDHD,  SWS, WKWBT, IWABO, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Stianed, Atone Sour, Offspring, Cage the Elephant, Green Day,
(Honestly I could go forever.)

Hope to meet new faces on here ^^/)

hey welcome back you have quite the taste for good music so thats fuckin awesome
I'm not sure why I joined, but y'all seem cool. I usually bang around the mpa forum (Gerard gay on there) but wanted a little change of scenery. I like bands and people who also like bands. 

Happy to meet you all :)
Uhm, I guess hiya. If you love music and hair and cats I think chatting with ya would be fun. Also if you just want some help...be it fun, lame, irrelevant, useless, serious, strange, etc, MAYBE I could offer mine. Anyway HI AGAIN. If you want to talk about the obvious impending cat uprising then uhm shhhh We must discuss it. I mean cats are not people therefore 100000000x better. I like all animals but cats are just best. Oh and yeah I'm weird just like you (hopefully). Wanna message and or friend me please do. Or dont. I completely understand your choice whatever it may be. Thanks for reading. Cya.
If you have cats send me pics of them
If you guys want to add me and talk to me, you can. :)
I'll keep this short and simple...
Talk to me..
Thank you..
*Hugs Plz \(0u0)/...

Hiiiii my name is Ian-Andrew and I'm new here. Feel free to message me and what not! :3
I love your name dude x3
Thank you :)
I made this account a long time ago but recently decided to start really using it, so I thought I would introduce myself!
I'm kind of a nerd...I like video games, card games, board games, (pretty much anything except truth or dare). I listen to all kinds of music, but I'm always looking for more artists so message me (or reply here I guess) with some suggestions if you have any! (Just please no 50's or 80's music cx) I watch a lot of YouTubers so if you ever want to talk, start there and we'll be great friends!
I also really love dying my hair. I recently went half black and green, but the green is fading already. I might do pastel purple or a deep blue (like facebook blue) on the green half but I dunno- thoughts???
Anyways that's just a small bit about me. Thanks for reading x3
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Welcome :)
I go by Jacy Anne Wolf in this big bad world of the internet. I write, read, watch YouTube, watch Supernatural, draw, and sing a little. I come up with little tune every now and again, but soon forget how they go when I don't record them or sing them constantly. I've applied at Hot Topic and I've had an unofficial interview and an official interview. I'm currently waiting for a call for a second offical interview. Oh! I'm 18. I love cats and dogs! I do have other social media if you want to know any of them just ask, depending on what it is I'll give it to you. Lol I don't have all of them. Um... Some questions I've been asked before... I write weird romantic comedies that has some violence in them, good and bad. What I look for in a partner. Well I'm not extremely picky; nice, funny, has things in common with me, wants to start things slow, know how to handle me (yeah I get out of hand, but a lot of people do), and know what they're getting into, but doesn't care because they know they can handle it or are prepared to handle it. If you have other questions comment or message me, which ever you choose is fine. Have a nice day/night! :)
HELLO!!!!
How are you, Nimda?
I'm good nothing much has been happening x3 How are you?

You're an emo, you don't get friends.
Cassettes, if you hate emo subculture then why the fuck did you join this site? If he won't get friends it'll be because he's 31 on a site full of teenagers.

damn cassettes do you live to make people hate you or something? you are one of the most cynical bastards i have ever seen i just thought that you where just to dumb to grasp politics (wich you obviously are) but to bash someone for their personality is making me cringe...you must be a very depressing black hole of downer that just sucks the fun out of every situation like a class A douche.

Nice to meet another nonbinary person, and I love Misfits also! You seem coolio to me. Welcome to the site :)
Haii!
Hello :3
hey
Raaawr, just raaawwwr ^^
Hi, I'm new here. My name is Tristan, I usually go buy something like "Azazel," "Eldritch Prodigy," or "Emo Cthulhu," online. I'm a nonbinary person-mcperson, I use them pronouns. I'm hoping to make some new friends since most of my irl friends have been being real jerks recently. I like a lot of musicians/bands, genre wise they are usually punk, metal, emo, electronic, alternative, and pretty much anything in between (Electro-Punk, Synthpop, and Scottish Pirate Metal). My favorite band of all time is the Misfits (close runners up are Black Veil Brides and Radiohead). I'm interested in art, writing, and most importantly video production (my ideal career path). I've been sort of out of the online social media scene and creative path for quite a while and I'm hoping me getting back into that will help me boost my confidence and overcome a lot of my anxiety.
"I'm a nonbinary person-mcperson" watch out for cassettes the troll
It's Gas' job to alert newcomers of me. Not yours. Still, you're a cunt for claiming you're non-binary.
Nice to meet you too, cassettes.
Condescending prick.
I can tell this is going to be the start of an amazing friendship already.
cassettes, you not understanding something doesn't make is bullshit. If they don't feel like neither a boy nor a girl it's none of your business. As long as they don't shove it in everyone's face there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Oh god he's demisexual, too...
Except not everything that's not the norm is attention whoring.
"Except I completely understand it" No you don't, because it doesn't apply to you. Nobody can completely understand other people. God it's like you're just completely empty of sympathy
Not a psychic. I just have some kind of common sense.
I hope you're having an absolutely splendid day, cassettes.
I'm asexual, ya think that's for attention? lol. It's 2016, more people are exploring their sexuality. Stay out of things that aren't your business.

Well, I don't appreciate your ignorance and childish kneejerk reaction to me casually mentioning details about me. However, I do respect that when you have an opinion, you are at the very least vocal and honest about it.

Welcome, you may address me as Wolf, message me anytime and i will respond as soon as possible. Thanks
Well I'm Mackenzie, I'm almost 17.
I'm lame meme trash. I enjoy a wide variety of music, and I love cats.
That'a about it I guess, I'm not sure what else to put.
You can kik me @ Renee_Moreno1721
hi if you want a new friend u can add me or message me I like to talk to people I'm a nice person
Welcome!
Just joined the site - just seeing what its about. Wanted to introduce myself. Hello everyone.
i wish to make the friends
hi add me if you want I'm a good friend
yay :D
:)
Wanted to introduce myself, I'm here for intresting conversation and meeting epic people. Let me know if you're down to talk.
Hey there! :)My name's Tommy! :3
I play guitar in a metalcore band.I'm also a indie game developer and I have a game released with a new one due to be released early May time.
I play guitar and bass, and I'm pretty much guitar mad to be honest (as you can tell with me being in a band :D). Unfortunately my collection is small as I only have 2 electric guitars, 1 bass guitar and 1 acoustic guitar. I'm planning to add two more electric guitars, one more bass and one more acoustic to my collection soon though :)
I go to a gig around once every month so if you're my friend, chances are I'll drag you along :)
Feel free to message me if you want to talk since I reply to everyone.
Hey u can call me azrial or alucard I'm new here as my prof will tell u I'm the vocalist and frontman for a deathcore band called demons don't die wats up people
Hey What's Up?
Does your band have music up online yet? I LOVE deathcore, I'd like to hear it
Same here
I feel like the title is pretty self-explanatory...but I'll reiterate regardless. I'm looking for new friends. I'm a 19 year old girl living in Norway. I love reptiles, almost all music and gaining knowledge.

THEN WHY JOIN A FORUM FULL OF SELF-ABSORBED NUMBSKULLS?
There is more than one way to gain knowledge Hun. It doesn't have to come from a book or a documentary. Some of the most valuable things you can learn can come from others.

There's nothing to learn from anyone here.
Then why are you on here?
Because I've not nothing better to do with my time.

hi peeps. im elle. im 17. just turned 17 this last march. im from uk. midlands area. i guess iv been shifting between scene and emo for awhile now. scene is just more of a colourful emo i guess lol but just alot lately iv been drawn more to emo. have lots of stuff going on in my life right now. so dont feel that colourful. i dont know.. but why put labels i guess. anyways iv a bf. (so im already taken) always have to put that or people think im up for grabs. im only here to chat a bit. vent a little. got a cool site here and looking forward to chatting with others. cool so peace out.
The Midlands are shit.
aww look at you, with an opinon and everything. its a shame i never asked you tho.
You come on a public forum, and don't expect that? Fuck off, mate.
SceneKids is dead and Twenty One Pilots is generic shit.
So is your personality but I don't feel the need to go out of my way and post on something of yours saying that

Good for you. Say, what do you use for your photography?

No you're exactly that. How do I derserve it? You came onto my post being a cock for no reason. Fuck off
You listen to Twenty One Pilots.
"Twenty One Pilots is generic" ohhhhh boy.
You should stop making an account on this site every time you get banned and go join 4chan instead. You'd get along with everyone on there.
No, this is more fun.
I really think you should get tested to see if you're a sociopath. You really don't seem to care that these are actual people you're treating like shit, not manipulable objects.
Kk, how do I do that.
Hello! im new to this websie and im looking for some new friends.
You're an emo, you don't get friends.
Hey everyone, I'm Ty.
Lets talk about music. Like pretty much all kinds.
I play guitar. ...Bye.
Is your name really Ty? That's awesome
Yeah, I go by Ty or Tyger ...........short for Tyger Lilly, yes so girly xD
I need friends
add me if u want
I just got back on after years and I am not sure if people are as of active anymore? Anyway, I enjoy classic rock music as well as spoken word. Just got out of a relationship so of course I am broken hearted. I want to help people so I hope to be a nurse someday, a traveling nurse at that, since I would love to see a lot of the world someday *~* Love to read and watch anime, have long conservations as well as short, funny ones. I'm here for any of you at anytime. I'm 18. Senior in HS and I tend to get attached a bit too easily but I swear to you if a chance is given to me, I can be a pretty good friend. Feel free to message me or tell me about yourselves below ^~^

Let's play tag, i hide, You all try to find. 1, 2, 3
.....
Nothing better to do
Lol ahahhahahahah
hi welcome to emowire 
Thank you 
your welcome :) I'm a nice person to talk to
Haya ^,..,^
Hi...erm...i'm not good with introduction so i'll give it my best shot.
I am in need of a friend who is like me to help me feel not lonely (and if they are lonely like me then i can help them too) I have been used for as long as i can remember so it will be nice to have a true friend that i can trust and talk to. I like bands (e.g. My Chemical Romance, Sleeping With Sirens, Bring Me The Horizon, A Day To Remember, Panic! At The Disco etc.) and i spend my life listening to them with my headphones in. My emo crush is Dominik Santorski, from the film Suicide Room. (hence the username "abbydominik") I watch a bit of anime (Darker Than Black and Bleach) I watch MyDigitalEscape on YouTube and i am currently learning the electric guitar and attempting to write my own songs (wish i could sing but i have a crap voice) There are more "emo's" in my school (or so they say they are) but they don't like me because i'm not "popular" and the fact i am shy.
That's my introduction (crap, i know) But i hope i can speak to some of you. :) Have a good day or night (depending on where you are)
hey dere :3
Heya I love that film ahh the feels at the end ;-; we like the same bands so i thought id say hey xp and tbh i do the same i dont really talk to many ppl and just keep my earphones in xD
Well, honestly, when someone needs help, I'm a good guy to talk to, I'm funny, random, and very serious when the time comes.
I had another profile on here under a different name and I can't find it.  :(

Sooooo I made this new one. :P

Top 5 Fandoms: 

Supernatural 
Doctor Who
Flash
Reign
Arrow


I have way more but those are my top 5 favorites. 
What are yours? (:
DOCTOR WHO IS F***ING AMAZING!!!!
hi guys im new here add me im so foreve alone T.T xD
Hi
Yo ~.~
ooooo Psycho Pass sounds cool, what's it about?
My friends told me to join this and "express" how I feel. So I feel like I'm going to cut.
hey there :) you okey there ??
If only
i asume thats a no then
That's pretty much right
you can tell me if you want
Hmmm ok fine....my friends and family told me that I want attention and don't care about their feelings and that's why I cut according to them...and basically now I'm friendless and familess and it just seems like no one would really give a fuck if I just cut too deep one day and ended it.
i want to be your friend i think you need one to tell stuff to its a lot of weight you carry i think.. maybe i can help you aut a bit
I don't think anyone can help me :/
i dont know bout that its just.. let em try and help you in anyway people can and i think youll be suprised what can happen
:/ I want to but I have a hard time trusting people
i can be trusted with shit i dont want too set people up against each or destroy em by telling stuff if say im gonna help you bet your ass ill be the one trying the hardest saving you from anything
Well than...thank you.
sooo whenever you feel like talking about shit you know where to find me:) and youre welcome :)
:) cool
glad i made someone feel a bit better :)
Me too for the first time I don't have a weird urge to just end it...thanks so much again
youre so welcome for it.. you deserve some love and friendlyness to you know
Hm that's odd most people I know usually tell me that I need a mental hospital but I like ur version.....I think it is hard for people to be nice to me thou cuz I look like a very mean person at times and it freaks than out :/
well i guess they never got to know you or talked to you cuse that can make difference
Ah that is true...hm ur pretty cool....I have a feeling imma be able to trust u
^^ then im doing a good job
XD can I ask u a question....do u usually try and talk people out of suicide?
i tried twice and failed but i think i know how to keep em here.. one survived the other... never heard of again so i fear the worst... but ill always try till the bitter end
That's depressing but true I have only had one friend who killed hisself and he was my foster brother...none of my friends do it and they think I'm going to kill someone one day...they don't have much confidence in me

Well if you ever feel that way hmu I'll try my best to get it out of your head but I gtg now talk to you later
Byi
Hello! Feel free to add me. I care about everyone who talks to me and I would love to be here for you. If you ever feel like you need to talk, the door is always open :) Keep your chin up!
i have tried to kill my self.. bout 20 times. failed obviously. but you just gotta stay strong. who gives a fuck what people say badly about you. just ignore it because you are better than them :) talk to me anytime you need. i have confidence in you
Thanks so much. I get that I have to ignore people's words but sometimes it just gets to the point where I don't want to keep hearing the words and I give in.
honey i feel the same! i am literally going through the same problem as you. but all i can do is try to help you. just dont cut like i do sweetie.
Well I mean I have already done it...it's kind of a complicated situation but I just can't stop thinking that if I was gone than people would be ok with it.
98% of people online dont care if you kill yourself. 2% do. i am one of that 2% even though your family may act like they hate you. they truly love you and they are worried about you and dont want to except the fact that their daughter is hurting herself. my parents are the same. you just have to toughen up and try and be positive. evrybody think that if they are gone nobody would care but it isnt true
I guess now would be a good time to tell u that I'm adopted and I switch foster homes just about every year.....
:( im sorry.. i am adopted to. but dont switch... well fuck everybody!! you can always come to me to talk. ill be your #1 supporter
^^ thank you
^_^ np you got skype?
Did but I forgot my password...imma get around to making another one thou probably this weekend
ok cool cool when u do add me queenbae200
Ok ^^
Hey Abby how are you? I look forward to getting to know you a little more
"New people". Don't use the plural form, please. We're all the same people, just under different handles. Saying we're like-minded is a huge understatement.
hi there, hope you have avgreat time here and stuff
"Homies"
YOU'RE AN EMO. NOT A GANGSTER.
topkek
I was kind of here before the crash.. I didn't really know anyone though, because socializing is hard, and stressful. I'm hoping to make a bigger splash and meet some people this time around. ^_^;
hi :3
Hey everyone. So I thought maybe writing this will help me to meet new people and to make some friends. As I have been on here for ages and still haven't found many people to talk to. And have lost friends on here also. So my name is Kira, I live in England. I love animals. Especially cats. They are amazing =^.^= I love music, I listen to it all the time. I have some pets. I like to play games and watch films. I play bass guitar. I also like to read, write and draw. I also love vampires. I'll leave it as that as I'm probably boring you all. So yeah I'm hoping to make some new friends. If you wanna be friends or talk ect add me and send me a message. I'm always up to meeting new people.
yus i will be your friend i need friends too ^^
message me whenever you want here for ya
awesome i live in the uk too cx do you like any bands?
England, aye? Berkshire best county. ewe
Hey Kira. :)

'Ello, fellas. It seems Truth, I'd assume, has deleted my account. But, to quote Michael Rosen, "YOU CAN'T CATCH ME". So yeah.
Oi. How are ya?
Pretty bored, I'ma head out to the coffeeshop in a bit. I desprately crave a joint after being on this site for a few hours.
And I need to finish my Pokemon Alpha Saphire playthrough.
What 'bout you then?
Iunno, never really got the schtick of Pokemon. Why do you like it?
Bored. And full. Just ate half a can of condensed milk.
It's a simple, fun RPG with monsters that were a big part of my childhood. I don't really have good reasons to like it, but it's one of the few games I really enjoy playing :p
I've never had condensed milk... I don't think they even sell that here
Wait what? It's a pretty common baking ingredient. Check your supermarket or something, they gotta have it.
A trip down ol' memory lane, eh?
I'm new here and I am happy to meet you all ^^

Scenekids is bland. Very bland. Drama is at a minimum, and the community are almost robotic. This place Is simply condensed drama and edge, though, which in turn makes it, in some respects, better.

Same route, I was the odd one out, I was the random nobody knew or really cared about. And honestly I never liked high school. Take it or not, I made it and graduated, but feeling left out and lonely sucks, unfortunately I still know the feels upon that. It really does suck. But I'm sure you're generally a nice person, and could make awesome friends :)
im here for you
Thank you guys :'( 
its cool but maybe you should open up more. slowly invit yourself into things. speak them into existance and open up more with ppl and by that i mean just go with the flow eventually good friends that truely like you will stay and come around more, good luck.
P.S. I know these seems easier said and done but when you know who you are and what you want to be then things just happen to go your way. plus those ppl making fun of you still dont know who they are they're just lost.

well i can say this it WILL get better and i know exactly what u are goin through and yes it is incredibly tough to be left out n bullied (was bullied from 1st grade to 9th grade in 3 different schools so i feel for ya) but i can also say this being left out n being beaten down both psychologically n physically builds character n inner strength and i hate to say it but im stronger now after i suffered through those 9 years of hell. but what i did was i started lookin elsewhere after likeminded such as alternative forums n such and i found people who loved me for who i am and those same people are the ones who helped me get rid of most of my socialphobia so my tip to you is talk with people who cares about u for the person u are and fuck the rest basically. the bullies and people who gangs up on others who is different or in any other way not conforming is so incredibly pathetic excuses for human beings they themselves are so fragile and weak that they must feed on others selfesteem and terrorize the ones that sticks out of crowds, those who just blends in and are to afraid to express themselves (u know wich ones i talk about the copypaste people who seem to like everything everyone else likes n follows every trend n listens to everything others lsitens to n when that isnt the "in" thing anymore they move on n starts following the endless lines of robots again following in the masses likes n dislikes its actually quite fascinating to see how afraid most are to express themselves n be unique) so being bullied for being u or being left out its not u in any way shape or form its them, so my advise is to actively look in plaes such as this after people who wants to hang out with u because they like u as a person and i promise u u WILL find them! :D so hang in there cutie :) things will get better ;)
your welcome
Hey there everybody!
why'd you delete me? ):
You deleted me.. before I could tell you that I love you.....
you guys are way too creepy
says the guy who steals other people's images off google and lies to people about who he really is on a teen site for depressed people ._.
well you are acting as a bully on a site where depressed people come on, congratulation making my day harder. I bet you feel great about yourself now. It feel great hurting people around you? you like that?
sexual predators force people into things they don't want, just like you. You're a bully and a sexual predator.
Maybe because I don't feel good about myself and because I'm feeling bad inside. Thx for reminding me my life sux, thx for bashing me right away. Congratulation on being a bully on a site like this.
you are both being bully and judging me right now
._. well when you lie about your appearance you make people angry
and the only thing you are doing right now is humiliating me. Do you feel better after humiliating me for the past few minutes?
great job at humiliating and bullying other then. I hope you enjoyed it.
You are so emo dudeeeeeeeee
EMU GOD!
well people who try justifying their act of evilness like your are the worst
Baby forget her. We can be great together;3

Tell me you love me...
My days have been so worse.
 Now I know why. Cos you weren't in it.
I felt so alone.. And empty.but since you came in my life. Nothings feels the same. I smiled for a sec.
Baby I'm in love with youuuuuuuuuuuuu
Becauae catching a catfish is soooo evil.
I'm a 18 yo guy who live alone and have no friends I come here because I don't know what else to do with my life. Yes I do need help, because I haven't been feeling well in a very long time. thx again for being the sunshine of my day making it such a painful experience coming around thx
If you were putting a fake pic because you dont like your appearance then make a motherfucking post that it isnt you :P or put it in your bio?  Stop victamizing yourself and own up. Save the bullshit exuses.man. xD
Nav your the best x'D
it's easy for you to say such a things and bash all together on me.
Nav your killing me here X'D
Look m8.
These guys are right, your just like QuaHog or whatever his name is using one of the guys on here picture X'D
Fake. If your gonna be fake don't expect people to like or trust you cause for all we know you can be a actual perv.
Your life is bad? Oh honey.... That doesn't give you the privilege of being a catfisher..
So yea.. Consider it evil, mean, bullying whatever you want... But since your fake. No one cares about your opinion on them m8 XD mmkay? Mmkay
I'm ugly as fuck, you're happy?
I don't want people to know what I look like, because people don't give a shit for me.
lying about my appearance is the only little thing that gets me a chance to talk with someone. it's easy for you to judge me miss perfect, but you don't know me. You don't know how it's for me.
But at least I can tell you one thing, I sleep well at night. Because I don't bully other because I don't gang up on someone who is alone.
People on here talk to the users who doesn't have their profile pic. Or using a anime pic.
If you would've just said it's not you. 
We would've stopped there Itself.
TOP ZOZZLE.
Put this thread under "butthurt" in the dictionary
PUT YOU IN THE DICTIONARY UNDER "BUTTHURT"
^Because??? I was butthurt in this thread when?

Hi guys. c: I'm Taylor :3 I guess this will be my really-lame-and-probably-really-cheesy introduction? xD
Anyway, I'm 16, I have an unhealthy obsession with music, I love to sing, I play softball (I didn't want to do a sport but I did it for my parents and I ended up really enjoying it.), I love the metal genre and such in music, I wear a shit ton of band merch and skinny jeans, and the color black. Umm, my favorite color is dark purple, I have a best friend of 11 years (crazy, right? xD), I'm not really labeled as anything but most people say that I'm "scene" or "emo" or "gothic" on the inside because of the music I listen to and the clothes I wear, but I don't "look the part". I love anime, drawing, attempting to play guitar xD, and more.
I struggle with major depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, etc. I have been bullied from the time I was around 11 years old, till now and my life has just been spiraling downwards but I'm trying to stay as positive as I can. I know that I'm so far down into my depression that I can't really help myself so I try to help other people before it's "too late" I guess. :)
I'm not going to tell you all about how depressed and shit I am, if you want to know.. Just message me! I don't bite, I promise! :3
Okie, I guess that's all! x3 Byeee! xx
hey everyone I'm new here so feel free to add me c:

Hey. My name is Matthew Jacob Rose. I don't fit in it this fake, shallow and unemotional society so I thought I'd join up here and see what comes of it. I'm 20 years old I sing and play Acoustic and I mainly sing emo rock and alternative mainly the depressing love sort which no one appreciates. I love ambience and anime I want to explore and adventure but until then I spend my days with coffee, skyrim and my beautiful guitar. I had my heart broke and gave up who I was now my quest is to become myself. I'm not there yet. If you feel like talking say hey. If not s'cool (-_\)

I know that some people say that but then turn around and stab you in the back, but I'm not like that, I promised myself that I would be different from others in this world. I like to write my own little poems, that's mainly all. I may post a picture of myself on this site, depends on what happens. And I would also need to find a more recent picture of myself too, which will cause havoc for me (maybe). I'm just looking around for a few friends, nothing really special. If you want to know more about me then feel free to go to my profile or message me. I bite and hate if you hurt and hate me, but I'm loyal, friendly and protective when you're someone close to me.
Hey kids, I don't know what to say really other than hi. Okay now that I have greeted you three different ways, I'm Kae. I'm not very smart or pretty but I'm quite cool if I do say so myself. If you want a friend that sucks at life, finds it very difficult to start and/or keep a conversation and has very abrupt/inappropriate/offensive humor (because is australian) then hey there! You have very strange taste in human beings. xD. So same. Bye childlings. Or alternatively hi!
Heyy! I am just looking for some friends. Lately life been hmm well ehh hell. But we all have our own different types of hell, I am here for all you.
I can be your friend. I get busy sometimes. Sometimes I have to do chores other times my Mom's Scitzophrenia gets bad and I have to take care of her. But it is usually easier for me to do Kik than to talk here :3
anyone need someone to talk to i'm here. Im pretty awkward but i'm not mean. promise xD
PLEASE GO OUT AND TRY MAKE FRIENDS RATHER THAN HANG AROUND HERE, YOU WILL NOT FIND FRIENDS
thx guys means a lot.
umm except for whatever you said Cassettes
helloooooooo XP 
Damn that guy is mean o: and stupid :|
Me, stupid? No, what I just said is true. You're just deluded, that's all.
I feel the same way, not as cassettes but everyone else. If you want to kik or follow me on insta just message me here and I'll send u my info:-P
YOU'RE ALL DIGGING YOURSELVES INTO A HOLE HERE.

GrayFox said: Hello fellow christianGreetings GrayFox.... How are you?
I'm rather well, I'm gonna friend you so we don't have to spam everyone's notifications
This topic is currently closed down and I will not be recieving anymore notifications from this topic since I am recreating a introduction in the "blogs" section on the site so that the management or administration will be smoother and much easier. However, everyone's previous comments were greatly appreciated!!
Hey !ok first i'm french so i'm sorry if my english is a little bad but i'll try my best :pand i'm bad to introduce me too (what a bad start)so ! i'm a 16 boy geek and otakui love music in particullary metal (HELL YEAAAH) but it's not a reason to hate cute things like cats meooow :3okay has the first view i'm not an emo but many people tell me that i am one in my head
mmmh i think it's not bad for a first presentation i hope you will accept a non-emo person like me :3
On est beaucoup de Francais ici, t'auras pas de mal a trouver des amies
Welcome :)
Hiya
The sky, the sky is up.
Hi peoples. im kitty and im new. i need someone to talk to.
Greetings Kitty,
Hello there. . . Welcome to EmoWire! I'm known as 0ddBall on the site, but I truly go by Mellow since it's my alias. What brings you here? By the way, if you want to browse my profile feel free to do so before we start chatting. I enjoy making new friends yet I like to keep a mysterious air between me and other people. 
Furthermore, don't be shy to pop up randomly to talk to me--I don't bite. Well, not hard anyways. Aha! (= And if you have any questions, or concerns please let me know. I will try to assit you as soon as I can.
In Regards, 0ddBall
Feel free to add me and welcome to Emowire! :)
I'm lonely and in need of a friend near me. Not necissarily boyfriend/girlfriend/personfriend, just... friend. I need a friend.
Me. Im a emo
I'm super emo.
I don't want to weird anyone out. But I don't want to mislead anyone either. I'm a 42 year old man who loves guys and girls with the emo/scene look. Naturally they will be mostly a lot younger than me, but for me it's just a look I like, has nothing to do with them being young or old. (And I'm only talking people 18+ of course)
I've just recently given myself permission to like EVERYONE I like, REGARDLESS of gender or identity. When I did, my 20+ year old depression, sometimes to the point of being hospitalized for being suicidal, was GONE! I had never made the connection between the 2 things. I just knew I was attracted to some feminine looking guys (98% of guys do nothing for me) and was too embarrassed to do anything but try to forget it was there. So if my being here weirds too many people out, I'll leave and you can forget I was ever here. But when I was struggling with my sexuality, I was told not to just assume that who I like won't like me, so I'm not. :)BTW my name on the forum is Philgeta. My name + Vegeta LOL Look forward to hearing from you!
All seriousness, you might have a better chance finding someone on Vampirefreaks.com 
I do believe that they still have a larger active population and definitely have a larger age variety. (Not mostly underage people like on here)
I'll look into it, thank you!

Hi,

Hi
hey I'm kinda new here too
haiii c:
Yoooo just wanted to say hi......im harry 16 live in bc canada..............i love bands and lots of emo stuff..........i have my ears peicred and stuff idk what else haha anyways ttyl
Hello Harry, and welcome to the site ^-^
Hi...
I'm Liv and I'm a new emo :) I love writing, singing, listening to music, gaming, watching anime and drawing. I'm an emotional wreck who just wants to be accepted by who I am, not who I act/look like. I have like two actual friends who don't understand me most of the time due to me being bilangual(English is a native language to them) and they aren't into the stuff I'm into(music genre, games, anime, etc; where I live all these things aren't commonly seen, especially in girls). I would love to meet some nice people, but I'm kinda shit when it comes to actually talking to them, so excuse me for my awkward shyness :3
I see English as my 'primal' language, even though I am originally Dutch :) So I rather talk English than Dutch. I love MMORPG's and MOBA's, though I can appreciate some FPS like Destiny or Titanfall(I suck though :P). I'm from Apeldoorn :D
I'm more of a LoL player, I've never played Dota, though I would like to try it one day. I'm quite fond of Smite too, it's just that I'm too addicted to LoL to play it xD I still live with my parents since I'm thirteen... :P I have two dogs and two cats, the dogs are named Noor and Sansa and the cats are named Lola and Lyra :)
yea you should try dota once :) its pretty fun. i have played LoL but i like dota more :)
yea i get you still life with your parents :P iam already old XD like 21 already XD feel pretty old here
but cool you have so many pets ^^
I'm not one for MOBA'S, but I do love a good MMORPG and. I LOVE ANIME. If I could get paid for watching ANIME...I would do it instantly
I didn't to capitalise ANIME a second time
Mean to*
And you HAVE to finish Clannad and Clannad: After Story, they are both soooo freaking good
Haha, my sister keeps forcing me to watch it and I absolutely love the series, I'm just so scared for the feels train that will hit me ;_;
Lol uep
Yep*
I play league :D You on EUW?
Yeah, I'm on EUW :)
Same.
I'm really shy but um.. Hi... Just um goi to my profile I'm really quite nice but if you um put your finger near my face I might bite... Jk
Hi! I've already got a girlfriend, but I've always got room for new friends.
Hi my name is EMOLesbianxXxX and I have room for more friends but I'm really shy at first though but yeah I would love to have newer friends =)
.. Um, same.. So yeah.. Hi
Greetings madam, it is an honor to meet you, perhaps we can chat sometime? I apologize if i am overstepping my boundaries.
No, no.. It's fine.

hi if u want new friends u can add me on here I'm a nice guy i am also shy and I deal with depression I'm shy
Describe Your Self In One Word ?
for me 1 word wouldnt be enough lol.... so i wwould say a depressed anxiety mess or just a mess in general haha...
I think I could in two words: alternative geek :P
As you have seen, I am new here! I am questing for a specific kind of friendship. I always feel super lonely. Most people I know have a best friend who they do everything with or who just gets them on a deeper level. But I have no "bestie" in this regard. Therefore, I am seeking a person to wander the dark gardens of life with me. If that sentence made no sense to you, you are probably lacking a bit of the poetic element needed to be the one.
That aside, even if you who is reading this are not that one I am always open to friendship and conversation.
Sup
If u need a friend I'm here for u just add me 
Ok bye
It feels weird, typing as if I were talking to someone o.O but whatever
you don't need to hide
Easy to say... .
everything will be ok
Im new :3
I love BVB BMTH FOB PTV P!ATD ect.. I lovYouTuber like Johnnie Guilbert, HeyThereI'mShannon ect
I wanna make some freinds here 

              This post was edited by XxLoverxX at December 12, 2015 10:17 PM EST
Hey im Shane we can be friends if you want to
Hello I'm new here and I don't even know what to say but whatever... I'm obsessed with bands like bvb, ptv, bmth, mcr, sws and many others... I am looking for a friend so please add me, I will be a little bit awkward at first I guess, but if we get to know each other I guess I'll be more open... More about me on my page... I hope someone will answer this and add me... .
Hey! I'm new here too :)
Hii, I'm new here too C:
I'm new here just looking for friends or whatever I can get really lol.....that was not desperate at all. I'm not desperate, I just don't have friends that have similar interests as me or are going down a slightly similar path. I would listen to any music that's appeasing to my soul at that moment but I have been very fond of BVB, Three days Grace, system of a down, and Kamelot. I'm a Pagan Witch in training (I call my teacher Yoda) and that's where abellona comes from its my witch name which means Bringer of Destruction but I guess we can add some rainbows in there ....I think I have said too much so just talk to me for more lollipops and skulls
Hi, I'm Courtney. I love to draw and listen to music: mostly Black Veil Brides, MCR, Get Scared, P!atd, Twenty One Pilots etc. I just need someone to talk to I guess. I'd be there for you if you needed me and I would try to help; I know what it's like to be a reject and bullied for who you are. I also like to watch anime: I only started watching a couple of months ago but it's amazing ^-^ So...this is me I guess xD
hey what's up ? :) im azazel

Hello, names Orin. 


Im 18, big fan of video games, horror movies and kaiju. 

Im not exactly an emo but, I like emo people. Same for Goth, Scene and metal girls.  I don't enjoy the whole "Date normal girls" or the "perfect girl" type thing. I may say I love you but, don't take it to heart because, you'll never know what love is until you live with somebody (as my grandmother said). 

Fave shows: Regular Show, Steven Universe, Hellevator, Killer Kids, Adventure Time, SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Dr. Who (Matt Smith is the best). 

Hobbies: Gaming and drawing. I like Graphic Novels every now and then. Comic books too :) 

Favorite movies: Give me Godzilla movies or George A. Romero zombie movies, or any good horror movie in general, and Im good. 

Music: Dubstep, Metal, some Post-Hardcore, a bit of Pop-Punk and Underground rap along with Horrorcore
This information doesn't tell even 0,5% about You, and about the way You avoid normal girl, whats normal? You finding that special one from the anonymph place what seems to be weird indeed (internet). As Your grandmother told You, You'll never know what's love untill living with sum1.  And sorry about manic questions, I never mean bad though I may sound so.

Hellooo! I signed up here about an hour ago, and it seems alright so far. So, it seems great! I haven't made many friends, but the design of the site is nice. I'm a really sensitive, shy girl, who's just looking for some friends because the people in real life aren't too lovely.. (If you'd like, you can read more info on my about page.) Anyway, if you are considering chatting, or even if you aren't, have a lovely day, people. :3

I just joined. Not quite sure this works, but I just need some friends and "allies".
I feel so different and alone - even when I'm in a crowd with LOTS of people I know, I still feel alone.
Me too, I'm new here as well, and haven't made any friends yet people added me but I don't talk to them? I dunno maybe it's just me.
Thank you so much for your reply :-)
Maybe other in here are shy as well? I can only guess. I'm glad you wrote to me.
Well that's the thing I'm shy to but I like to make people feel good, as I always wish people could make or help me feel good. Hah. It's no problem feel free to add me or message me whenever (:
Funny you say that, because I also have a gift and an "ability" to make people around me glad and feel good - I just don't feel anything the other way around. Have you ever had the feeling that you are "hiding" yourself behind a smile?
same, i joined on here to make friends because i feel so damn alone..
BrokenSoul; Hi there, thank you so much for writing :)
How do you feel alone? What do you usually do, when you get that feeling?
Yeah I hide myself all of the time. It's the "mask" I wear on a day to day basis maybe I got good at it considering I do a lot of customer service. I dunno I. Just alone and tired of the empty feeling
I feel the same when im in a crowd i feel so alonebut hi
How do you all "handle" the loneliness you feel when you are in a crowd?
And what thoughts are you having behind the "masks"?
Honestly I've never in "crowds" the most I can handle is about 2-3 people including myself. And as far as "wearing a mask" and how the thoughts are, I don't about others but, for me the only thoughts I can have are like "why am I even here with them" things of that sort.

Hey there everybody:)
I'm not too good at introductions so here's my attempt: my name is Keith and I'm 21. I used to frequent this site site under the Alias Cretin frost back in like 2011-2012 so I doubt I'll see too many people I actually know. Anyways I love to make people smile and my only goal in life is to make one person smile every day (any more than that is just a bonus) because you never know how much one smile can do for someone. So why don't you message me and let me make your smile the smile of the day.
But in all honesty; message me if you ever need anyone to talk to; I'm a great listener.

Heya,
I'm Hannah and I live in Tejas. Where I go to school, everyone calls me goth. Their labels are not only stupid but inaccurate XD. I don't technically, or offically, label myself "emo," BUT people do SOMETIMES, and I don't really care. I'm turning 16 soon and I'm currently a sophomore. Eh I do well in school which makes it REALLY fun when I get to my classes with all the "prestigious" kiddos :'D, and they realize I'm the only one in the school who looks like I do. My school is composed of carbon cut-out, orange, bleached blonde hair, and pearly-white teeth girls. Honestly, idek how I haven't been bullied yet. It may be because I "scare" people with my bitch face XD. My natural expression just seems like I have a stick up my ass. ANYWAYSSSS what makes school worse is a thing I will never admit to the "real world." ....Boys lawl...They don't exist here. Well, they do, but not the ones I find even remotely attractive :'D. I've looked EVERYWHERE, and I can't find one boy I can drool over XD. Stupid school- they need to recruit some peeps to make me happy :P. I didn't really notice it until all these people were raving about a lil thing called homecoming. XD Ik it's stupid. Ik it doesn't matter, logically. BUT I work my ass off in school, get all a's, endure my parents (who are very harsh), go through the normal emotional stuff, and have like zero friends. It just sucks that ALL of high school seems to be me being studious, watching all the leathery-skinned girls strut off with the EXACT SAME BOYS. They all look the same.
Classic case of barby doll cat-walkers. They look for people who they deem attractive and usualy get them because there so 'hot'. Ugh.

I'm Vincent (Vince is fine) ... I enjoy gaming (mostly League of Legends but others as well), listening to all kinds of music, drawing and watching anime. I'm horrible at introductions but feel free to forward any questions to me, chat, etc. 

Looking to meet some great people here!

tthat's cool well im always up for finding new things to listen to so if you find something you'd think I'd like feel free to suggest it to me

I guess this is my chance to say hello and hi. HIIII :D
might as well, hello back and all
sup I'm Stevie
hi
Hello
sup
Hi
how r u
I'm new to this site and I'm not the best at introductions and starting conversations......so here I am!!! :P Sadly, I don't have a phone that does cool things so I can't Kik but I'd love to start talking to new people who are good with conversations xD
Heye ! How are you?
Still here so doing pretty good :P how are you?
That's true and this is a good place to find people who can relate and help, anytime you feel down or lonely you can message me(:
I greatly appreciate that! Thank you :)
Sure thing. Some people can be stupid af and just friend you but never try and talk to you or respond so there's that. It's all about the rankingxD
It's an emo site so it's expected people are gonna be moody and shy but yeah you're right. There's a lot of really cool people on here still though
True. I tend to be a bit moody and shy sometimes too so I really have no room to talk.
Me too haha I just feel you don't have to be so full of yourself if you know you're not the only one with problems. I tell it like it is
I hardly feel full of myself. Just lonely
Oh nah I was just speaking in general. I know, even with people there's still loneliness
It's ironic isn't it. I don't care if you're in a room with a million people or with only one, you can still feel alone.
Exactly. Well I have social anxiety as well so it makes it hard to be around a lot of people anyway xP yet I live in Atlanta Georgia
I have social anxiety too. Believe it or not, I've had a panic attack from just having to go to the grocery store. -_- and damn atlanta georgia?! you don't have it easy.
hi I'm Stevie
No it's not easy, that's a lot of different people x/ my mom's had anxiety attacks the same way so I empathize
Hi Stevie!
Thanks MyChemicalEmotions. Any kind of anxiety problem is never easy to deal with.
how r u doing
Pretty good now that there's a storm outside. It's kinda weird but I kinda like gloomy weather. how are you doing?
It's just my first day here haha

                    Thefallen
Hey
Hiya
whats up?
Well nothing much besides laying in the dark
story of my life.. Im doing the same
I cant sleep unless i pass out
I load up on pills
I don't touch pills
how come? I just do it in hopes one day I will find a good combo to where I wont be waking up
Dis hoe....
c:
Hope this helps someone out
I can relate to that. And Im still trying to but its hard hope you feel okay.
I hope so too, to be honest, as much as so many things have brought me down, at least now I have a lot of advice to give hahaTWOFACE, the only thing you can do is give a damn about yourself, respect yourself enough to say, fucking hell, I deserve to be alright, and do everything in your power to get there, even if it's just listening to music that makes you feel better, small things add up to a lot
I'm going through what you're going through so it's understandable. There are people like yourself who would give a fuck about you. Like myself even though I don't know you. But the situation is abit worse for me but I just need to remember to focus on those who matter to me, those who give a shit. That is what you should do so you don't end up like me :/
I didn't mean for it to come out that way. I didn't mean to make your problems seem insignificant and to offend you. I was only trying to help you out.
I understand an i didn't mean to sound so rude about having it more harder than your own problems. I just feel like crap now :( apologies for such a mistake i made
Hi

Hello! cx
Hai. cx
Okay, so... Hello, fellow human. 'Sup? I'm not sure at all what to write here, but well. I'll do my best. 

I'm shy, that's a good beginning. But I love making friends. Yeah. :| I love to draw, both digitally and on paper. I also play piano, loves music and rain. I have Synesthesia, and if you wonder what that is..- HAH! Go ahead and ask. xD
Welcome to the site!We have most of those things in common :) I've been playing piano for about 13 years now, I love drawing, music & the rain as well :DAhh...as Synesthesia is quite rare I believe you may be the first person I've met with that disorder.
Thanks! :) 
Ohh sweet! O_o Thirteen years? Wow, that's waay more than me, hahah! 
Yeah, Synesthesia is rare, and you're probably the first person I've met to know what it is! xD
How long have you been playing? :)lol! well if it wasn't for me being in Medical school at one point, I probably would not have known what it was xD
Oh, that explains it'! 
Well, I've been playing piano for.. Maybe  two years or so? I still suck at playing from sheet, so I guess I just.. Play. Listening to a song, remembering it, then play!^^
Hi I just joined I really like cosplaying and I have 2sisters and looking for friends

Omg the wait for fallout 4 is so real
and battlefront 3
well, let's introduce myself.
i'm emily dudi, and i live in the Netherlands, yeah i feel kinda small between you guys right now (i do speak english properly don't worry. i've been practicing since i was six). eeeh i just thought maybe i could make some friends here since there's not a lot of people out here who understand my style. i'm kinda new in this so please don't hate me for not knowing that many bands yet, haha. i did fall in love with my chemical romance a while ago and i'm pretty addicted. but i've listened to more bands and i liked them all really. i'm kind of strange but i guess it won't show that much on a site like this. anyway i talk too much xd
nice to meet you, you perfect little creatures. 

              This post was edited by emilydudi at June 21, 2015 7:32 PM EDT

Hi...I'm from Maryland.......I'm 16....I'm looking for friends/boyfriend/girlfriend.....I'm pansexual, so don't message me if you're against that......and....yeah. Have a nice day I guess...
Yo yo yo :D
hello ^_^ lol not being bored on here is easy lol but also tough
Hey everyone, my name's Hailey and i'm just a slacker that likes to draw things and play video games. Sometimes I tell jokes too.
Would love to make some like-minded friends here. let's be angsty together.
Hi Haley
Hey nice to meet you! c:
Yeah I'm Kendell
All my friends have been deleted ;-;
Hey it's misora massacre here! All my info is on my profile. I love to meet new people but no preps becuz ew
I'm Shannon. I'm 18, recently graduated and I don't know how to adult. I've always loved darker styles and now that I'm out of school I can really express myself. I'm an artist, I love anime. I love makeup, and good music. I'm in love with a wonderful guy and things are serious and it's great. I'm a friendly introvert and I'd like to make some friends on here, so feel free to say hey [:
x3 
What's the drizzle my nozzle? I'm Riley: Emowire's friendly Canadian
Hey you sound pretty cool, wanna be friends? :)
Why not?  XD
Hai I'm new to Emowire too, I'm pretty shy but once I get used to someone I am allot more confident (usually) so I usually use the internet to talk to people and make friends. I also love Panic! At The Disco. I wouldn't really say I was a BOTDF fan but I do like ALLOT of other bands out there. It's real sad to hear that you lost all your friends, I've lost a few of mine due to similar reasons too :/
im sorry that you lost a few friends too. and i'm the same way, shy but then more confident. and i love a lot of other bands like Fall Out Boy, Falling In Reverse, Korn, etc... so yeah c:
Right, I'm gonna try my best to be nice, buuuuut... Yeeeeeaaaaaaaah...

Other than that, what up yo?!

My name is CJ and yeah that's about it :p
I found this website looking for the filthy degenerative people. The ones who got beat down by society. Rejected by the "cool kids"

I don't consider myself an "emo" guy if that's even a thing. 
I think im bipolar or schizophrenic ( A LIVING FUCKING HELL)
im not quite sure,too scared to find out..Im that guy that is creeped out by everyone. Nobody would look my way. I would spend my days in my room I call hell, writing poems, drawing and playing the guitar ( trying). Im tired of sitting in the dark alone. I want to seek what's out there, starting with you guys. 
So I ask you.. what's your story?
when i was five my parents got divorced . when i was eight i got into the party/gang life and started messing with drugs then when i was in the 4th through sixeth grade my dad beat me then when i was in 7th grade my fiance begain beating me as well got pregnant he beat me until i lost the baby . then i begain to cutt and from there the shit gets worst...
Sounds like you had a rough life. But it shoudnt stop u from achieving happiness. You actually inspire me to keep on going. Your pretty strong and i hope you find what your looking for. I would hug you but the screen is stopping me cx . There's still a whole lot ahead of us, for better or worse and i wish you good luck on this one and only unique quest. Keep strong and if you need someone to talk to im here...
Thanks
Hey, I don't realy know what to say so I'll cut my story short. I spend most of my days in my room sitting in the dark. I cut myself a lot (i think i have a problem) and I keep it a secret from my family. I like writting, reading, and listening to loud music. I get depressed a lot and Ireally don't know why. So thats my story, hope you like it.
Haiiyaa~ I just came across this site...so im here bored and waiting for you! Lets get to know each other whether you are you think we're not going to get along. Try me ;)
Hiiii there ^-^
BatMans bae. Bae is life!! :D :D sorry Im bored
Not quite sure what to say o_O but uhh.. Hi? New, I no life video games, school, anime blablabla
Just joined, hoping to meet new friends. The name's Wesley. I work at Dairy Queen, and just fuck around in my free time.
Welcome to the site :)
I have none of those but Hellow~
Hey dude!
umm,hello!

Well my story huh, hmm i'm a girl nobody wants,  a social outcast, i like music and anime, have very little friends been deppressed since i was 12, bullied, i screw things up, hmm what else, ehh that pretty much sums my story up
Hi I  can relate to that. Never really had a true friend, besides one. I always hung out with people who would make me feel like shit.I consider myself a stepping stone with their egos I eventually found it better to just wallow in loneliness despite of bieng.. well, lonely. I screw things up as well in fact I kinda screwed myself big this time.. well anyways what type of music you like? Not really an anime person.

Metal, emocore, rock, dubstep, some pop, some rap, and dats okay and i screwed up big time with my ex
Not sure why it reposted like 5 x lol xp
Idk either CX
Oh that's cool I'm kindve the old school music type. Nirvana, pink Floyd, doors, etc.. Never really been into todays music besides like asking alexandria.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. You wanna talk about it?
Idk its pretty screwed up here is a sumerization of it: he introduced his friend who just got dumped, cheered him up for a while, he gained a crush on me and i sorta did. My ex didnt know about it at all untill one day his friend kissed me and guiltly sank into the kiss and i didnt notce that my ex was watching and he dumped me and now his friend and him are harrassing me
Well he's not really a good friend in my opinion. And from your summarization, I don't think its your fault. It's not wrong to have feelings  for someone else.. although I do feel bad for your ex how he saw that. I've been in that position.. but if I really liked her I would've forgave her and trusted her that ir was a mistake nd as for his friend he's a douchebag for wrecking a "friends" relationship and harassing you for it. But keep your head up, there's always something new around the corner. Or if he did like you he would do anything to get you back
Yeah now i know that he never loved me
But I love u now so it's okay.

Hey not much. Just woke up
I'm very awkward, gonna say that right off the bat. My name is Jess, I'm 14, and I'm overly obsessed with Pierce the Veil. I mainly joined this site because I want a boyfriend that actually has things in common with me. Every cute guy at my school is into sports and only sports, and all the nice ones (or that i find nice) are either gay or already taken. So, if you're interested in me for some crazy reason, message me or Kik me: jessdoesstuff
Hey Jess, message me or Kik me 

deadleif
Hey Jess, message me or Kik me

Hi I'm new to this website and the whole emo scene and am also really nervous and shy. 
I absolutely love music and anime, they're basically my life lol. 
My fav bands are Sex Pistols, Nirvana, Interpol, The National, Editors and Black Veil Brides. 
I love playing music. I play guitar whenever I get a chance and when I'm not doing that I'm drawing. 
Basically I just have a relatively boring life with too much time on my hands and I hope I can make some new friends here.
well, it's nice to meet you c: it's okay to be shy, lots of people are. You have good taste in music :)
niiiice music XD
sweet
hai *waves* ^-^ :3
Hello! I like anime as well.

Omg I just finished watching Tokyo Ghoul Root A. Now I'm just reading the manga
Ohhhh! I cant find the manga anywhere!! I really want to read it, it'll explain these Haise joke i keep seeing!

http://m.mangafox.me/manga/tokyo_ghoul
You're welcome c:

I've never been one for introductions...
But all I can say is I'm a very old member that as washed back upon the shores of this site...
If anyone needs someone to talk to,
Maybe for some advice, drop me a message,
I'll try to get to you as soon as I possibly can,
As long as you mean well, you will not be shunned by me,
You shall be welcomed in the best manner.
But please bare with me, I am a bit.. Shy..
As I'm sure most are.
Till then,
Fare thee well...

I love music and my guitar. I'm left handed. and well i dunno what else to put on here. I play guitar, i scream, i try to sing and at the moment i am woozy from lack of blood from donating blood. So yeah, this is me i guess.
Howdy. Sarcasm is a good thing. Welcome.

Eyyy people, call me y'all can call me Dez, Rin, or Dezrin. I'm new here, so... message me, breh. I'm hella awkward, so I apologize in advance for any weirdness that may ensue. Also, just so y'all know: I say "breh" and "bruh" a lot. Not sure why. Weird Ohio lingo, I guess.
I call literally everyone darling, hun, sweetheart, dear, and love. So don't think you're something special if I call you those (okay, "love" is a bit more special, but that's completely beside the point).
Sooo... yeah. That's it I guess. I'm lazy and don't wanna type anything else. Message me, darlings - I don't bite that hard.

-Dezrin

Hey there. Welcome!
Hi vicky
Hi :3
Hi. Welcome!
'Ello. I'm just some person who's obsessed with cats, corsets, steampunk, and hair/makeup. Sleep is my life. Call me Frost or Leah or Liam or whatever. Depends on my gender for that day I guess? I'm kinda awkward. I'm genderfluid but that wasn't an option ^w^' I use emoticons time to time and say 'yas' and 'y'all' and stuff like that. Partly because I'm weird partly because my family is from Georgia :P I've lived in Kansas my entire life. No I have never been in a tornado, no I don't live on a farm. ^w^ I sometimes use emoticons excessively so sorry if I get annoying!

In my free time, if I have any, I hang out with friends, watch anime or read. I listen to all kinds of music. I love talking and meeting new people, I guess that is why I am a psych major. No I will not analize you. Feel free to talk to me!

Hey guys and girls..
So my account along with I'm assuming everyone else's was lost.. Yeah kinda annoying but, upside is, now is a good time to make new friends, add some new people and such, the ratio of active/inactive members will be a lot better...
Personally, I've wanted to re-do my profile, now I have no choice xD

I love talking to people and just making friends in general.
I just want advice. Cause whenever I block someone they can still message me and shit
If you block someone they cannot message you. That would ruin the whole point of blocking you dense motherfucker. You click the block button and the person cannot see your profile, add you (which they HAVE to do to send you messages, only your friends can do that), or see your posts. You're obviously not blocking anyone.
Weird, maybe my computer is just glitchy af
Making your profile private isn't blocking. Or, ya know, you're just a fraud because if you're not friends with said troll they can't message you, period.
I think I understand what the problem was, it would take a bit to explain and i'm tired so l8r
Okay I'm gonna block you and then you come here and try to type something i need to test my theory
Think I found what's wrong with your computer http://blasze.tk/PN2FRD
Blocked people can still post on your forum threads mofo.
o
If you're the troll's second account, I have your IP address ;)
I'm not don't worry. The guy's name was Hugh mungus on here or some shit
No shit? Trolls here have made two accounts before. One to troll and one to pretend to be trolled. What you said on this thread and you making this thread to begin with doesn't add up unless you're trying to get us to acknowledge the troll. Ergo, you could be the same person.
"it kills my candy emo buzz"? Come on, man.
I'm a candy emo.
Probably haven't figured it out but that's not my real name.
looks like someone here is trying way too hard to look unique.
"candy emo" or me because my fake online name is Laurasia?
My only concern here is, as a Nunmoose, I don't appreciate that people take pride in their mental disorder and try to pass it off as "I'm unique and have [madeup "gender" identity]. It's extremely unhealthy. I can only hope that Miranda seeks the mental help she so desperately needs.
I'm not even? Go bother an actual sjw about that. I'm the gender I was born as. Not giving a shit what people want to be doesn't make me part of that group.
XD WTF, ok first of all it tends to be a waste of time trying to change someone's mind with your unorthodox methods , when their minds are made up, i used to think that i was half spider because i was bitten by one and thought it was the kind that bit peter parker, and noone could change my mind , second of all , if gender is decided through x and y chromosomes , then what do you call someone who is born with an x chromosome and two more broken x chromosomes and one y chromosome , and is born with absolutely no body private parts or anything that may differenciate a masculine or feminine look?, and third of all who the hell is miranda?

true but since they are neither boy nor girl and they are still people, they have the right to choose a different choice , and my point with the spide thing was that noone coul change my mind , only i could, also i didnt say you insinuated the chromosome thing, i was just using how gender is scientificly specified
and either way , what you say is toxic to the young mind , is just reality, people like different stuff, i have a friend who looks and talks like the spitting image of steriotypicle hawiian surfer dude who is SO into porn that he has multiple memberships rings condums to school everyday, and even plans on becoming a porn star once he is old enough XD, its just the human mind and it wants what it wants even if its bad
boi that was the shittiest ddlg blog i have ever seen.
Yes, they can choose, they choose between the binary male and female, but please show me any store or bathroom with "agender" on it. What is toxic to the young mind is feminist and liberal propaganda. I don't give a fuck about anyone's kinks, what I do give a fuck about is vulnerable and mentally ill children trying to push themselves into 18+ BDSM circles with no concept of what kinks actually are or know of the potential dangers of people in BDSM circles and which safety precautions they should take. So many infanticized 15 year olds go on tumblr claiming to be a "little girl" not knowing what they are getting into. As for chromosomes determining gender, you were entirely irrelevant to the thread at the time I even said that. I was telling BulletForMySilentSuicide/SoleilDormant that she need not insuate that I believe there are more than two genders, because she assumed the person making the callout post for trolls was my f4ther and I. You were strawmanning that my argument was specifically "if gender is decided through x and y chromosomes", when I said no such thing.
I have no idea who LeftAndGone is and I am not getting involved with you and hughmunguses mental shits
funny, we know it's you. you had the same profile pic as your current profile before you changed your name on it.
LUL @ LAURASIA (TAKEN FROM UR FACEBOOK THAT UR MUM COMMENTS ON)
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE HAX AT DARK BOI? GET YOUR BLACK HAT FAGGOT SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU IRRELEVANT PIECE OF SHIT. KILL YOURSELF (((((((:
those "XD" emoticons only show how braindead you are, seek medical asistance as soon as possible.
yay more entertainment, watcha gonna say next O.O
My F4ther Cohort is not irrelevant, I enjoy his humor very much, and don't ever insult him by even coming close to suggesting that he'd ever be friendly to a democrat. You seem to have a double standard here, you say he's so much of a no life that he cares about the size and color of font, but I do the exact same thing. Do you always insult yourself for the sake of an internet battle? Do you per chance want to visit my Summer Kampf? I'm sure you'll qualify.

i also highly recommend you to drink gene pool purifier, it will help this planet if you do it.
you actually took time to look up what i was talking about? that and the fact you said "us" and how you always seem to find which account is his is starting to make me think that your the same person, also hacking is not as simple as opening a command prompt and putting in some random things, being a black hat means i hack to my own personal gain , if i take 12 hours out of my life just to ruin an internet trolls life , then im hacking to my own dispense and either way i wasnt even the one who brought up that im a blackhat , he just scrolled through my bio just so he could try to use something against me, and last of all what do you mean meme , ive read through my comment five times and have yet to see what your talking about
not a pool that you piss and swim in, a gene pool. drinking some gene pool purifier would provide a healthier more clean gene pool if you drink it.
*expense* fuck
alright you got me on that one
i wasnt really attacking you, im just interested in the way you think , so im making conversation, and no i dont have some problem against having friends, im just aware that if you were the same person, then thats the ind of stuff you would be doing, also i never said that someone was wrong for mentioning i was a blackhat , and i run with the bullshit windows 10, where i cant even find microsoft word without out googling, its even on a handmedown computer that cant last 5mins off the charger so yeah it would take around twelve hours, also im not a self proclaimed blackhat , my dad when he was still a cop yold me what i was doing was "blackhatting" and that if i didnt stop that i would be "in a grave, under a bridge, or in jail" , so i googled it and found out i fit the description
How is insulting my F4ther, a man who I view dearly, going to get you closer to observing the way I think? We do this because we find it enjoyable. If you're interested in the way I think you clearly find me intriguing and enigmatic enough to devote time, why assume I would make such a rookie mistake and slip up on the pronoun game? I am very much capable of speaking in the singular first person. That story was so much bullshit I actually think you may have surpassed the buffalo in the midwest as the leading emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Great dad you have there, I'm glad that's past tense, because I wouldn't want an asshole so blinded by familial ties that he doesn't arrest his son for breaking the law. You were told what you're doing is illegal (yet you say you have respect for the law), you were told the dangers of something you didn't even know had a name, yet you say "yeah I'll totally give myself that moniker." What?

Your dad must be so proud when you DDoS kids off xbox live when they're better than you. For real kid, it's funny you think that's my real IP too...who the fuck is Jacki? Please hit me back after you can build some shells to shake my server. Now go back to 000webhosting to log IP's with your fake links. Fucking Skids.
;-; why no replying ?
soooo. i like this boyyy.. we've being sitting at lunch the last few days together i give him stuff i make him laugh.. but i tink i might be too emo for him & idk how to tell him i like him.. what if he rejects me or never talks to me again!!! wtf should i do?
fuck people we are all the same nobody is above anyone, just stay your sweet self dear
Theres a girl at my school that likes me. Ppl know that she likes me. She knows that ik that she likes me. But no one knows i like her too. One day she tried talking to me at lunch & i was really really really quiet to her cuz im socially awkward & too nervous to talk to her. She probably thinks im not interested in her but i dont want her to think that. Im just to nervous to talk to her. Idk wat to do pls help me
listen here you fucking pussy. girls don't like weak men who can't even talk to a girl they like, grow some fucking balls, walk up to her in the hallway or in the lunchroom or wherever and be like "hi, let me get your number".it's 2016 and there are still pussies everywhere.
I have tried talking to her a few times so dont call me a fucking pussy
you're still a fucking pussy for not asking her number. you know that she likes you, everyone knows that, so what would you lose you fucking moron?
I would definitely try to ask her that if there wasnt a good chance she doesn't like me anymore
quit being a little bitch and do it. man the fuck up.
Ok
Ok thanks
Yeah, just be yourself, it helps a lot.
Dude just give her a cute note
You'll be getting laid for sure
Thank me later
"send nudes" should be on the note.
worst advice given.
Not really. When it comes to relationships and stuff like that, being yourself helps a whole damn lot,
I love that picture xD
asking her out while being yourself does put you at massive risk.
Ok
Don't listen to Aryan, he is just some weeb who thinks he is cool. You need to be yourself or there is a chance that you could be known as a "fake dick" and then you would be bullied to death for lying
you call me a weeb yet you're the one with the anime profile pic. if you didn't know i am cool as shit, so get your facts straight. you're making it seem like if you ask a girl out the most straight forward way possible you will be known as a "fake dick", oh and being bullied to dead that is highly unlikely, use your head dumbass.
You can be bullied to the point of suicide and you literally photoshopped an anime thing into your profile photo.
miranda we know who you are, there is no point of making fake accounts.
I remade my account from the constant fucking bullying because of something so stupid.
or you can grow up and realize that hey, if you're being bullied online then you're totally not supposed to be on the internet. the reason for that is because you take everything close to your fat self. i have written a forum post on this and i will link it here. i also would want to quote tyler, the creator with a extremely important quote "hahahahahahaha how the fuck is cyber bullying real hahahahaha nigga walk away from the screen like nigga close your eyes haha".http://emowire.com/forums/topic/8853/most-effective-tactic-to-combat-cyber-bullying

"Something so stupid" Miranda, you consider your own sexuality and gender identity stupid?
Yall aren't here to fight. If yall r gonna fight, at least do it somewhere else
nigga we can fight anywhere we want.
When I was smaller something happened an I can't tell my parents cus I'm embarrassed an it haunts me an I remember it is hate it I do an I want to end it all but when I try all I see are my parents so I can't bring my self to do it but I tryed everything to help numb it but it's only temporary an only makes me hurt more it's gotten so bad I stop talking to my friends and I even left school cus I feel like everyone knows I tryed to runway to somewhere no one knows me but I was found an it only made things worse my brother see an sister hate me cus they don't know an I'm just don't i have tryed so much that I feel like if I don't try one more time I'm just gunna pull the trigger to end it all I do is sit in my room all day an smoke to help forget but I still remember all of it an I just want it to stop please help
if you don't tell what this event you're embarrased about in forums then you're just wasting time.
Ok but I'm not telling anyone I haven't told anyone an I don't want to
Aryan is right we can't really help you if you don't tell us what happend. If no one knows then there's really no way of stopping it unless you try to push it away and move on from the past or at least getting some help or telling someone you trust!
It easy to say
It's not
An to admit it happen idk
It happen when I was little  an kept happening till I was 9 but why did it happen to me why not some one else
From a distance, your icon looks like a really hairy vagina
mate, it's pretty easy. a few years ago i used to wrap myself in seran wrap and smear baby oil allower myself and fap to that. you see it's really easy especially because no one knows any personal information or even what you look like so it's not even embarrasing to say that because no one knows who you really are (unlike my situation).
Yea but that's different
it's different because you have no personal information about yourself on your page and most importantly you have no pictures of yourself on this, so it's only in your favor.
No because it's not about me fapping it 
I wish that would be less embarrassing
Fine but don't make fun of me frs
because you know everyone will know who you are and all of that.
Whay do you mean?
What*
Oh nah like you said no one knows me an I'm bouncing my ip so it's just I don't like admitting it
you do realize what i meant to say was that you're safe to say it due to the fact that no one on here know's your personal information so there is no point of hiding it.
It doesn't make it easier ton say
But I was sexual assaulted multiple times by my dads cusin an my mom's brother so many times an last time I saw my dads cusin it all came out an I started to beat him till he was unconscious an they asked if just left an my mom's brother always bring it up I hate it but I can't do anything cus he is always has a knife I hate it cus I always see em both
Your family sounds super fucked up...
No my dads side isn't only him an mom side it's all fucked up they are either in prison or crazy house or on so much pills that they're dumb
I don't want to be here anymore I want to end someone help cus I'm tired of it if I can't get help fuck it there's always the permanent way to end it
When I was smaller something happened an I can't tell my parents cus I'm embarrassed an it haunts me an I remember it is hate it I do an I want to end it all but when I try all I see are my parents so I can't bring my self to do it but I tryed everything to help numb it but it's only temporary an only makes me hurt more it's gotten so bad I stop talking to my friends and I even left school cus I feel like everyone knows I tryed to runway to somewhere no one knows me but I was found an it only made things worse my brother see an sister hate me cus they don't know an I'm just don't i have tryed so much that I feel like if I don't try one more time I'm just gunna pull the trigger to end it all I do is sit in my room all day an smoke to help forget but I still remember all of it an I just want it to stop please help

Yea but that's different
it's different because you have no personal information about yourself on your page and most importantly you have no pictures of yourself on this, so it's only in your favor.
No because it's not about me fapping it 
I wish that would be less embarrassing
Fine but don't make fun of me frs
because you know everyone will know who you are and all of that.
Whay do you mean?
What*
Oh nah like you said no one knows me an I'm bouncing my ip so it's just I don't like admitting it
you do realize what i meant to say was that you're safe to say it due to the fact that no one on here know's your personal information so there is no point of hiding it.
It doesn't make it easier ton say
But I was sexual assaulted multiple times by my dads cusin an my mom's brother so many times an last time I saw my dads cusin it all came out an I started to beat him till he was unconscious an they asked if just left an my mom's brother always bring it up I hate it but I can't do anything cus he is always has a knife I hate it cus I always see em both
Your family sounds super fucked up...
No my dads side isn't only him an mom side it's all fucked up they are either in prison or crazy house or on so much pills that they're dumb
I don't want to be here anymore I want to end someone help cus I'm tired of it if I can't get help fuck it there's always the permanent way to end it
Suicide eliminates the chance of anything getting better.
Well fuck it I don't want to be in family anymore I hate being looked down on cus I know they know something but not what happen an they make me feel stupid cus I hated going to school so I stopped at 6th grade an I hate how they bring up the pasted an how I was bullied an they do it to make me mad an it makes me look worst an I hate feeling like shit cus they use to jump me my cusins an my lil brother would get me when I was younger an I hate it but they think I'm making it up what happened an the think I'm doing it for attention one time I had everything planned out had the gun an was ready to pull it but all I saw was my dad an only my dad missing me but he was the only that cared how can I leave him when all I wantted was to leave them can't do that but know I'm questioning that
Sometime I think I should have done it
killing/torturing them would avenge your destroyed childhood
What no I never said that
I really want help can you give me advice or something cus I'm so close to the edge an I dont want to keep goin
A social worker might be a phone call away
My brother burps very loud and I have a burning desire to beat him at his own game and burp into eternity. How do I achieve this level of mastery?
I am really lonely without having any friends in the real world.... I would like to have some real friends that I can have daily conversations with, talk with about my problems and having someone who understand me....
Same
Im pretty lonely irl & online. 
I only have like 2 friends & i don't get to see either of them irl
I'm sure you'll find some freinds in real life it's not that hard. Though I know how sometimes it can be :l But I'm sure you'll find some real friends and even on this website!
Hi! I'm Kiki! Please to meet ya!!!!!!
My girlfriend left me for someone else and now i cant seem to find someone what should i do
You either keep trying or you just move on with life until you find someone again or someone finds you
K
You either die on the tracks or live long enough to become a train....
I work with trains nigga
Okay that part about becoming a train is an amazing idea xD

Ywah it would bit I don't want to be that big lol
It's not about fiding someone else.
You'll never be happy with anybody until you can be alone, by yourself and be content.
I do!
Hello I'm an emo italian girl and I'm about to cut my skin again, I haven't friends because I'm shy and people is so bully with me, I have so many problems with my mother too so I feel so alone and sad. I have this heavy on my heart and the pain is so strong that I cut myself all the times. :( I'm so sad and I don't find a solution :( I will never be happy. :(
I have the same exact problems (mother issues and cutting). Let's be friends? c:
Yes
Hi guys...um same issues as you..feel free to include me in this friendship..haha
I also cut myself cuz it helps me somehow to forget about this f*****g life.I haven't friends but when they need my help then i have milion of them then i just say:''F**k ya,always when u need my help u suddenly become my friend''.(Add me if u want.)

i don't self harm and i never have done but if you guys need anyone to talk to or just someone to listen to you then i gladly will :)
im sorry im the same way too but my parents are just idiots do they even know who i am no they dont i want to kill them or me! ahhh help me
i cuted my hand yesterday so i didn't felled that hurt
oh man that sucks
oh man that sucks
oh man that sucks
never cut myself ever because i find that it doest help. talking with people and finding people who will love and support you is the only cure. if you want, you can talk to me about your problems!

I've been there, it hurts and it can feel like it will never get better. But it will, maybe not today or tomorrow but it will. There are people here who obviously want to help.
I cut too, and i found that squeezing an ice cube works just as well, without blood.
Never in ANY way harm yourself. That means hurtful words towards yourself, cutting, burning, bruising, and more. Don't do it; self harm at the begining may seem like hope and like it's your friend, but it isn't. Self harm makes you believe that it is the only option, but really, it isn't. Talk to a teacher that you like about your problems, it helped me when I had a friend who was down. They have no choice but to listen, and they will get you neccessary help.
I for one have to say that it is awfully scary to get help. I have to agree with Alana if you want help you look for it but, I have to say that teachers freak out. They make it a big thing and make you feel like a freak it causes the issue to flame up awfully but sometimes you have to take these risks if you are endangering your own life. I for one sucked it up and I learned to deal with my issues and for me the best way is to help people who have the same issues I can't completly explain how it works but it helps to know that you tried to help someone from making the same mistakes that you made. I know life is hard and death is easy but in the end we are rewarded with so many painful memories but so many beautiful people that you just haven't met yet. Anyone can die. Yet not anyone can just live we are survivors in a ring that has no god and no devil. We are in a sea of darkness and we are drowning some of us have given up but before you do there is someone who dives in for you and pulls you up on their ship. They give you a choice to either take you back to the land of the living or to sail with them to find others who are drowning so you can stop them from becoming a part of the dark sea we call depression.
Man for those who said they self harm I'm sorry for all of you. Nobody deserves that kind of pain. you guys endure enough to make yourselves want to cut then you guys ruin a perfectly good body maybe even a healthy body(I say maybe cause idk all of you) but its all right. If you need a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk too I'm always here
hey. i used to self harm. very badly. and at times i feel like going back to it. it was a very dark time in my life. but i got through it. and i can help each and every one of you. anyone who self harms can add me for a little support and help. and we can be each others support group. Ok? OK! haha. add me people! :3
wanna know what you can do? man the fuck up and stop being such a little pussy bitch.
About to cut my flesh open... Someone please talk me out of this.
You could use something that won't kill you, like small burns or rubber band smacks, cutting is dangerous

DO IT FAGGOT
Is it me or cutting is so addicting? But I just can't stop no matter how hard I try
You're just pathetic.
Haha really? Thanks for the Advice . 
I don't think I am because 
1-I stop a year ago i have thoughts of doing it but I start doing something else so I won't be tempted but just wanted to see what people would say. 
2-don't freaking judge me you don't know what ive been through . If you were in my shoes you would already be dead. 
3- this website is for helping not shooting people down. 
4- I did nothing to you to say something like that at all.
The sheer fact that you'd be tempted to cut if you weren't doing something else is quite pathetic. The fact that you cut in the first place is just sad.
It's is sad, i would   admit that, but what really matters most is I haven't done in a year and I'm trying, and everyday I'm getting better, my life isn't easy you know l.
What's so GOD-AWFUL about your life, then?
It's pretty long, you sure you wanna know?
It's pretty long, you sure you wanna know?
Jesus fucking Christ, yes. Get on with it.
Ok ok, hold your horses. Okay do you know what it's like to never have a family always wishing you were dead the family always beating you do you know what it's like to be raped by someone when you only 11 years old and watch someone commit suicide in front of you and you cannot stop it  and being in so many foster homes being bullied at school and say that you're ugly that people hated you and nobody loves you I felt so alone for so long I shut off my feelings so I couldn't feel so cutting was the only way i know that I was somehow alive. There's more but I don't feel like saying it,  I was told I was never by my family and all the family's I've been with I was an unwanted child . That why people told me no wonder why your parents in Cambodia didn't  wanted you,  you were useless.

Learn english.
Hey  now don't be rude
Hey now don't be a guilt-tripping little shit.
Haha you're so funny you asked for it tho.
Yeah, sure, but you could have said "I was X, Y happened to me, etc", not "Do you know what it's like to be X? For Y to Z you all day".
Nah, it's not as meaningful. Sorry I'm a poet. Gotta let people relate to me.
So basically you're attention whoring?
Haha no no no, I hate attention it scares me. When i write I want people to know I understand their pain, so I just some how write like that.
That's right,  but knowing more pain  then others I still can relate but there is always someone out there hurting more then me. So they can relate when I write about my pain.
You don't get my point... You're implying they don't know more pain than you, that you're more important than them. Hardly relatable, is it?
Well it seems I put it that way, but no I'm not saying that. I just write because I want to it helps me and if it helps others I'm really happy. I love helping other people
Sure.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's supposed to mean "sure".
Ok I know that. Well  I do. K so we should be friends
Okay then.
Yeah!! After all this I thought we  became such goods friends

Damn Ik how you feel and I'm sorry
I know a lot of people either say "then do it" or go along with a whole bullshit story of how everyone will miss you and kill themselves. But serously, don't let others tell you a bunch of crap thats only going to make you feel worse. I know you posted this message looking for someones help but none of these people will really understand, because they don't know you. You need to find exactly what helps you cope, wether it be taking it out on inanimate objects or actually going to a therapist or someone you trust. If this doesnt help, dont keep looking on here for some one to help, because i guess nothing will. Have a great day and dont do anything youll regret later.
Question is asked in the title. I'm going to ignore for now but they'll probably comment on this so whatever.
Grow some thick skin, don't be retarded, be smart, be able to defend yourself.
How about you stop bullying me when I have no line of defense since i'm brand new to this site? Also i'm not retarded, I have the IQ of 138. That's smarter than the average person. I'm legally a genius in my country. So stop, leave me the fuck alone, and shut your stupid ass mouth.
You don't, you wait till middle school ends and ignore them. If they're still bullies in high school it means they won't be successful.
I'm in collage
And i'm still bullied, especially on social media
No way you can be in college when you can't even spell it right.
But thank you for the advice
Sorry I have mental disabilites. Please ignore my terrible spelling.
If your IQ were 138, you wouldn't be an oversensitive flower. Probably wouldn't be on this site either.
I am in college though. I'm a freshman at CNM
So do I. Tourette syndrome and ADHD, diagnosed when I was seven. Doesn't stop me from ignoring bullies.
Excuse me? So you're going to be an imature jackass as well? Thank you, you are making my day SO much better
I try to ignore them but they are persisant, especially on social media
I only joined this site because of a friend. It was a mistake to think I could try to make friends anywhere
Line of defenses can be built now. Also, what skitzo and autist is like this? You seem pretty desperate when you start pulling out that IQ score. lmfao.
That IQ doesn't help with your spelling ig...
You're just an insecure bitch.
How am I insecure? I'm telling you how it is. I'm actually quite happy with myself.
Not if you're bullying me
How is being honest being a bully? I think if anyone is insecure, it's you.
If you get affected by "cyberbullying" it's because you walk right into conflict. If someone calls you a stupid poopyhead pr whatever, block them and forget about it. By replying you only invite more. If you were so smart you'd be aware of this shit.

^my internet is shitty ignore the double post
Academics? So why can you not spell properly with that high school education?
Because i'm bad at spelling. It's my weakpoint. Everyone has them, including you.
Fuck em is what I say and I want to warn you that almost all of the popular users on this site are rude as fuck. But don't let that bother you, it's just words. I don't know why they have to say that shit but eh. Just find the people worth staying for even if it's a famous person or something. I'll be you're friend haha
Tell me what my weakpoint is. Also, spelling and grammar are somewhat a BIG deal. Defineefine a weakpoint. Like the ones you have by showing your insecurity and failure to live up to that "high IQ".
Thank you! You seem friendly! First person to act nice towards me. DustMoon089
Exploit for "DustMoon" is that she goes on sites like this to find an "emo dude". I mean if you can find a weak point in me, great.
Your weak ponit is that you realize others are kinder than you so you bring them down.
Not really, I don't envy kindness. If you're smart, you'd know that no country has gotten anywhere by being "kind". So if you like being a weak little prick, great. If not, I suggest you get mean and honest.
I'm not like you. I'm kind, smart, honest, and helpful most of the time. Instead of bullying other people I take the time to compliment and care for others. I believe peace is the ultimate good, and that of every leader that has conquested over another country was a complete enemy to society, like you. I will ask again for you to please leave me alone and respect my opinion, as I respect yours.
I don't ask for you to respect my opinion. If you lead people by being a fairy, you will fail. What peace treaty has worked? Yeah, we may care for others but overall, why? Why not just provide? Look at Putin and Hitler. They have total control and have/had others by the balls. Peace may seem nice but it's a shit idea. Kindness is a vulnerability, I notice it and act upon it. Simple.
Half of my family was killed by Hitler. I do not mention him.
Well, that just shows you aren't meant to lead or anything. You're weak, and links that are weak break. So you should maybe not try to act like a leader when you can't even valid point and also refuse to mention a God-like leader such as Hitler.
You're a terroist aren't you? I see it now. You've nothing better to do than hate on other people and kill others for your own satifaction.
So I kill people now? A terrorist does it mainly with motives such as religion, political views or anything that relates to social aspects in life. I just am honest and giving a valid argument. If you see me on T.V beheading Christians or shooting up nighclubs, you can win. As of right now though, I'm just a guy telling you how it is.
I didn't mean it in a literal form. It's an expression of speech.
Pretty radical figure of speech there, bud. Also, it isn't really hate towards you, you are too irrelevant to be "hated on". I guess I'm a terrorist though. And by definition,"a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims". Am I terrorizing anyone? Granted I have political aims but am I physically threatening or terrorizing you? If I am, please tell me how, I'd love to know.
You're harrasing me for trying to make friends. You are "terrorizing" me by using methods that are unjust by using words. I have asked you to leave me alone. I don't like you nor want to talk to a bitch like you who thinks harrassing other people is fun to do in their spare time.
Don't bring me into this rude bullshit anymore, it's not funny dude.
And yes, I want an emo dude lofl.
Don't bring me into this rude bullshit anymore, it's not funny dude.
And yes, I want an emo dude lofl.
You brought yourself into this. Nobody needed you, and you involved yourself. It's funny because you play victim like you probably play on emo dudes dicks.
Leave her alone you jerkwad.
Oh no! Whatever will I do? The fairy called me a "jerkwad"!! Will I ever recover? Yeah, I will. Get over yourself you ignorant autistic cunt.
I am a fairy. You're a demon from hell.
I can live with that, because at least I can fend for myself with good comebacks.
At least I don't harrass other for entertainment
It's honesty, not harassment. Also, I can spell better than you, so I think I win this fight already.
I don't see this as a win or lose thing. Nothing ws gained accept hate. That's not something to celebrate. That's something to fear, bucause it brings sorrow and grief.
Fine. Then you FAILED at the english language, you FAILED to prove anything valid. What you fail to realize is that the more you reply, the more vulnerability you show. Hate brings war, with war you get success. You can be hated or feared, but that builds character. The problem with you is you don't learn from mistakes you've made on this thread. You don't try to improve your spelling or improve anything in general. You FAILED. It shows what little worth you have.
You have little worth for not being kind to a new person. You failed in being a decent human being.
Why should I be nice to you? Because you're new? Does that grant you immunity to honesty? Hm, that seems a little sad. That just because you're a new kid, means I should instantly respect you. Makes no sense.
No, it means you should treat me like a human being instead of a punching bag
^that being said, I guess that means I am worthless, because I didn't immediatly respect. lmfao.
You choose to be a punching bag. You're a boxer, don't you swing back?
I'm a human being, but I don't expect immediate respect just because I can't fend for myself and I'm a pussy.
Respect and honesty should come first when meeting a new person. It shows kindness and willingness to understand another human being other than yourself
You lack that, which shows inhumanity
So selfishness is inhumane? Right, because I'm sure your parents got to where they are by being generous. Yeah maybe they kissed ass, but you get money by being selfish, you are successful by being an asshole, being selfish. Your "respect and honesty" shit is a standard. I don't have to bend to your standards. Plus, I am being honest. You're the one getting upset. If anything you're inhumane because you're lying when you say I'm inhumane, because I just proved you wrong in this paragraph.

There is a drug i take that helps me, it's called fuckitall.
since ever internet became a thing that belongs in every household arrived a terrible and devastating term called "cyberbullying" the phrase was coined after people started calling the action of writing insulting messages, and humiliation on the internet. As of the late 2000's individuals spent years upon years of useless research to combat this epedemic, but i have found the most effective way to do that and i will share you this extremely effective tactic that everyone overlooks, here i go.the first and most effective thing to start off with is to realize that when you're on the internet with no social media or any information about you on any website you are completely anonymous meaning that you are literally a entity, but when you decide to show your fat face on the internet you are putting yourself at risk of people writing offensive things to you, so again you have to be careful and know the risks.now, pretend some random person starts insulting you there are many things you can do, crying about it and screaming "there is a guy that called me a hunchback of notre dame" is the worst thing you can do, instead take this situation in a more mature manner, utilize all the features of the website and use them all for this. you can block the person, delete the comment, or be actually mature and ignore it, or even better laugh it off don't take it close to your heart like you take everything into your fat porkhole.i hope that this helps everyone who reads this and didn't know about this, go kill yourself you fucking horse face looking communist thunder ass pubic chode scroungy cock sucking pussy eating nasty greaseball vagabba the slut looking coon with too much makeup.sincerely, friedhelm

"I'm afraid about telling my parents I'm emo". It's not like you're coming out as gay. Like for fucks sake. The fuck you got to sad abt anyway you're 11. Go fly a kite or sommen. Like I said before, grow balls and get out of ur MCR Papa Roach phase (((((((((:
Holy fucking shit you fucking people need to get a goddamn grip on yourselves. I'm here to jerk off and watch porn where bored Russian women pretend to have non-consensual sex, not read the blisteringly stupid whining of a gaggle of retards with mile-wide delusions of persecution.
Here's an idea, OP, you fucking walking turd, you vaguely human-shaped pile of afterbirth, why don't you post some content so I can bust my nut and get back to my miserable existence instead of bitching when a) you clearly have no idea what's going on and b) figuratively has nothing to do with you?
Christ what a bunch of fucking crybabies, what a boring, pathetic group of shitheads. The one upside about having to read this stupid shit over and over and over (and over and over...) again is I really do end up feeling better about myself. I may be a loser, but at least I'm not at the point in my life where I actually believe some mythical SJW is going to somehow stop me from masturbating.

Want help? Think before u act, kiddo. lol. No one on this site wants to help an 11 year old who doesn't understand what a phase is and sounds like he just came back from an English seminar. Grow up, and be urself (emo isn't urself).
OP post is sad. Makes me sad. Girls wear make up because of unfair social standards forcing narcissistic tendencies down their throats to the point where it's considered acceptable, so much so, that women hold women to higher standards then men. And they do so with much more brutal punishments for deviance from materialism and surface beauty. ( I personally would submit my opinion, that this is due to a sense of shame that they carry for themselves that they don't measure up the standard either.) All the while men sit back and appreciate the work their forefathers helped put in place by objectification and sexism. ( coupled with this, I also believe that women have a desire more so then men, to be loved, led and cherished. And to get that, some will give way to the lust of men, the void of the latter, makes lust appear as a substitute for the qualities they seek. ) Men lie for plenty of reasons, and I cannot pretend to know all of them. That said, I would argue, I think shame, and fear, are the essential motivators. ( shame still roots in fear.) Men are charged with the responsibility of doing what's right for the person they claim they love. Is lying, to protect yourself, falling within the bounds of her best interest? Questions that we all need to ask ourselves. The reason I found this post sad, is that it accepts dysfunctionality, and stereotypes genders into something wrong, and pain inducing. It speaks of the creator accepting brokenness in a relationship, as if they have never felt what real love and responsibility feels like, on either end. ( I personally would suspect a female artist ) it is sad because this person could have so much more... And they settle for the lies installed into them by society. That men have to lie to protect themselves, and that women have to be something more than they are ( and thus lose themselves) to be an acceptable* suitor. You can disagree with me, that's ok. These are my thoughts and opinions, and thus the reasoning behind why this post makes my heart lurch in protest to this artists ( as I ) perceived, beliefs.

the entire thing here reeks of troll from f4ther and gabehorns side. f4ther acts exactly the same as cassettes (perhaps its him who knows)
BUT yeah i agree with raeanna and to be emo can also be a start for a lifestyle in just an alternative direction (goth for example i even have friends who used to be emo and became skins) and the keywords for being alternative is -to not care what others believe or say about ya-
It's a sunday if you didnt notice, a day of relaxation to do whatever. I spend it on forums and playing games. otherwise i work during the week and on Saturdays if they need me in the office. you on the other hand are calling me out for just being on this site, which you are probably on every day all day because you have no life or job. At least i know what fucking day of the week it is you smelly weeb. Days of the week actually matter to people with responsibilities and jobs. lolololol Telling me to get a life on my only day off. That's great. Now Run along and fold your laundry your mom washed for you. also nice job at saying anything intellectual to retort to what the convo was initially about. you are quite the debater there mr high IQ
OKAY. im sorry im not worth your time mr. fabulous life who's only day of is on a sunday, but if this site is for little nobodies like me and my friends then why are you on it? why would you take time out of your "only day off" to argue with ppl that arent "worth" your time? if all you can do in your free time is mess with ppl younger than you then appently your the one who doesnt have a life :/ and i dont know about everyone else but im 13, i dont have a job or need one, so and most likely neither does alot of ppl here, so go fuck off to someone who gives a shit :D
It's a meme u dip
It's best not to give them any attention RaeAnna I mean that's what every troll wants trust me I know! x3Jaden smith....
XD okie fine w/ me lmao
He did not delete his account, you fuckers reported him.
Who is this f4ther? Like he seems like an asshole. I hate him already...
LOL "these days", "kids", 11 year olds think they're so high and mighty now days. "I'm so different and smart bc i see the world for wut it truly is"...no pal...you don't. Climb a tree ffs.
ok but do u not understand that u are a target on the internet when u are at such a young age? you may think predators are as easy as "bad person do bad things so block them" but predators can be anyone. you should not be on the internet at 11, you should be riding bikes and coming back inside when the street lights come on.

gotta agree with gabehorn here i must say, predators prowls on these kinds of sites like mosquitos with malaria infests somalian villages
my girlfriend frequently gets "modeling" offers and that they represent som modeling agency, that is how they try to get the girls atleast
and they target these kinds of sites first n foremost

Funny how this girl deletes her comments showing how shes all for this 11 year old. Then when everyones opinion went in the direction of "you shouldn't be on here", her tone and purpose changes to that. Shallow...
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF RAEANNA
D: i really have no idea what you just said. and im not saying he should not be on here im saying that he needs to be careful! gosh if i didnt think he should really be on here i would report him, but its his choice and unlike all of yall i havent told him he neeeds to get off. im just simply saying that its dangerous. :L and there is nothing wrong with standing up for someone, thats not shallow....

It's shallow that you change your standing on a situation as soon as it goes against your original opinion. Also you deleted your comments so you're also a big ol pussy.
i did not delect them, my friend did, she cares for me and doesnt think i should be talking to you, and honestly i dont blame her and i dont care if you dont believe me or call me a pussy, call me all you want and reality check, i never changed my perspective, i told him to be careful because younger kids are the bigest targets.. i never went aginst him :( noicte how in these other ppls comments they are saying that he should leave im just trying to help, there is nothing wrong with trying to fucking help someone when other ppl are all agist them.

Jesus lord you are stupid. That's not my opinion that is a fact. A serious fact. My prescription is ritalin and chemo.
i am sorry if you cant see this, but you are wrong.. you might wanna delet that. it kinda makes you look stupid :P and i could almost swear your the new account of f4ther. its bugging the crap out of meh XD lol the funny thing is that...
Jesus lord you are stupid. That's not my opinion that is a fact. A serious fact. My prescription is ritalin and chemo.
is suppose to be offensive?? but really im lmao because no matter wat i say you are just gonna keep coming back even though you know your wrong. so i guess i am just wasting my time, but thats okay cause i dont mind wasting time for something i believe in :D
YOUR grammar and spelling is enough to show how stupid you are. Go back to year 6 stupid twat. It was SUPPOSED to be offensive. Also, if you still use "Meh" you're childish af. Maybe go back and get an education rather than getting on forums and probably only giving the S U C C to guys over 18 willingly.
im sorry you dont like the way i type. 1s thus beterXS lol and if you have noticed im 13, and yes im childish as fuck XD and i am one of the top students in my gradel and i have NEVER gotten an F,D or even a C in English/grammer since 2nd grade. hehe :D sooooooooooooooooooooooo anyways im not going to keep arguing so have a nice life :) (im not trying to be a smartass im trying to be polite)
Top of class in what? 7th grade? Nice, Pre Algebra and Literature Composition must be so very very rough. Get the fuck outta here. It's not "the way you type" lmfao. It's the failure to prove you have no grammatical skills.
yes 7th grade. and no its not rough when you know how to do it.. :/ and yes i do have grammatical skills but its my choice when i wanna use them, so i can talk, type " fail to prove i have grammatical skills" the way i want to. why do you have a problem with that? i dont question the way you use grammer? so get off my ass bout it okay?
Well, as long as you're ok with being an idiot and having double standards. Great. I hope you kill yourself soon enough. The world would be better off with less retards like you.
this is hot as fuck
yasss im fine with it. and oh shit hes back XD
Man, sooo many people 0_0
yes, there is alot of ppl -_-
I completely agree with you, but it's whore.
What pisses me off, is a stable relationship with someone, close and comfortable enough to, you know, take nudes and send them to your partner for THEIR eyes only, and after months, you guys seperate from a big fight, and then they post them, and then you're clarified as a slut.Rumours are a big thing too, I hate them. Then you're also known for "getting around" when you don't.But yeah, some people won't consider the lives it affects, and won't stop.These 2 things happened to me above, so. Yeah, really recommend being careful.
ha sorry autocorrect
@nickasuar yeah it is a terrible game
If someone sleeps around or is a whore its their business and their business only. I don't see what the big deal is. It affects no one else but themselves.
I never said I have something against them I said I hate how lightly the term is thrown around
im a whore as i am older, i couldnt give a shit
I never said that was bad guys..
True. Your statement had negative undertones is all.
Sorry for the confusion :/
Nah, its all good.
You are right though. That word is thrown around so much anymore by teenagers regardless of if they are sluts or not. You don't hear it as much the older you get.
You're correct :c 
In my school I'm literally known as the school slut. Yes, I'm a virgin..
But my ex-best friend spread a rumor around that I slept with the group of guys I hang out.
Whatever, the term slut was originally used for girls with messy rooms :b
i wouldnt worry about any of it. words only hurt if you let them.
Yeah just because someone calls you slut doesn't mean you are...Plus if someone called me a slut I would automatically get suspended for beating the shit out of someone but you know i'm only defending myself..I used to be the SLUT untill a real slut came into our school she slept with a teacher and the crossing guard she posted pictures of herself naked to many times and she started grabbing girls ass's and guy's dicks so yeah and I am a virgin this day and haven't touch dick ever and I was the slut!!!
Yeah deep thoughts by dezzielee.
souch a terrible game us humans play :3
Yeah I guess that's life and if it is life sucks ass but enough said from me...
It does.
And people wonder why you get so angry I get really angry when I try to ignore to hold stuff in store them away but when I burst with anger everyone tells me to calm down and I can't.
I understand that :/
thx for understanding I guess
np lol
@tears: I had a very similar thing happen to me in high school. It sucked. People are way too obsessed with other people's lives. It's pathetic.
you just have to draw a line in the sand and stay solid to whom you are. haters will hate. lovers will love. i kmow what tiype of person i am. same as bullys, stand firm. it shits them when you smile back and dnt get pushed around any more
There's no "right" way to use the words slut and whore, because neither of those things exist. There are people who have very active sex lives, and there are people who care too much about what other people do behind closed doors.
If its interfering with an already existing relationship, that's when its a problem. But even then, nobody is a "slut" or a "whore", they're just a fucking asshole.
Sleep with whoever you want, 1 person in a year, 20 in a month. Just be safe, and don't be an asshole.

Exactly
Here in the Britain (assuming most of you are probably american) 'sluts' and 'slags' are extremely common insults thrown at teenagers all over the place. They don't even think twice before they speak here, any insult will do for them. And that disgusts me.
im not too sure on how i would go about editing my page !!! ive made websites with html coding but im not sure how to work with this !!!
meat said:
html coding
CSS and HTML are mainly using codes so it sucks
Also, how do I know he actually likes me, and isn't just seeing me as a walking visa?
Follow your heart hun, no one can tell you better than you. Just do what you think is right. Maybe hint at it a little and if he doesn't like you move on
get to know him. often there is more behind those eyes. Plus if you think this way about this guy, it doesnt say a whole heap for the long term stability of the bf anyways
Talk to him be funny around him and talk alot it happened with me yesterday my bf now was a stranger now hes my bf just talk to him alot and  remember be fun not serous in everything ^.^
Lets talk about me for a second. My ex and we were together for 4 years. During those for years I've met many girls from work, outside of work etc...even they are hot and beautiful but I've never once I have a thought about "wanting a piece of that". Mainly because I was with my ex during that time. Even though they can be beatiful and hotter than my ex but I didn't see it that way. I was with my ex and I totally respect her and I wouldn't do anything to hurt her behind her back. I respect my relationship and my ex. The lust is just a moment and something it doesn't last. What really matter is appreaciate what you have. You have to question yourself of why? How would your bf feel about know this? If your feeling about your current bf has changed, I would suggest to talk with him and make your final decision.
Well I don't mind being Single and all but it just seeing couples and people being all boyfriend/girlfriend is really bumming me out a bit where I'm like " i wanna cuddle with a person like that too" or ," i wanna hold hands with a person like that too." something mushy like that but I'm like " being alone is good and plus i won't have a broken heart" Ive been loner in relationships also so techinicaly i never really expericence a real/good relationship soo i really don't know at all
I know how you feel and it sucks
yea it does but you learn to cope with it
I totally understand; being single means you get a whole lot more freedom and you aren't obligated to anyone. Both have their pros and cons, definitely. Don't be discouraged if you're single -- I am too! :/
yea they do have their pros and cons i agree on that
Honestly, being in a relationship is give and take. There is always a power struggle within a relationship, I've seen. If you're missing some aspects of being in a relationship, why don't you just get a FWB? You get the cuddling and other things. Just not the drama of a relationship.
I'd say everything hurts, both being single and in a relationship.
But I'm just a total pessimist so I see just the bad sides.
Eh? Getting dumped feels ah... depressing, but it'll make you stronger. Relationships are totally worth it. But you must be prepared for it. It's a responsibility.
Should i just wait till i cab find an emo girl to try to date cuz i put so much trust into girlz but they just break my heart i just want a girl who doesnt mind constant cuddling
Yeah dude wait it out. wait for the perfect fit for you. remember you get to choose this relative. :)
okayz tankz yew mate ^_^
Well i got guys that hurted me so right now im just going to live the single life till I found that guy that would actually treasure me
the single life isnt bad there is stuff you can do without worrying bout your luv holding you back but i understand seeing people being all lovey dovey and you just being left in the shadows it really does suk
yea i know what you mean i seen that alot where ever i go
No matter what,or where I am I always feel alone. It's a terrible feeling that I can't seem to get rid of. I just always have the feeling that everyone hates me and is just pretending to be my friend. I worry that my girlfriend is only with me because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings or something like that. I'm that type of person who can feel alone in a room full of people. I just feel like no one cares and that it wouldn't matter to anyone if I died tonight. Why do I feel like this?
You feel like this because your mind has tricked you into thinking no one cares. I've just met you, and I care about you. To help, go ask some people you somewhat know if they care about you...they most likely will say yes! Or ask a teacher, they will definatly say yes. Trust me, EVERYONE you know would be shocked if you were to go missing, or even die. No person has no one, there is always someone around the corner.
Depression. Depression makes you feel that nothing is ok, that your being bullied, that no one loves you, and that you are alone. But in reality everything is okay and nothing is ever as it seems. Reality hits you in a way that makes you feel hated but I swear to you that you're not.
As a former High school student and an expert at having this feeling Shayfoxx I can easily answer to you with pure honesty, that this feeling that you have will stay with you for almost all your life. I don't know you I havent seen how you act or how you speak or how you present yourself to your friends and family so all I can offer you is an honest response. You and I and so many others are always in a war with our minds. The mind is a truly powerful thing. It can trick you It can hurt you it is the translator to everything you feel hear see and smell. So imagine it like this your mind is in a state of mental abuse from either you or family. Your mind is a part of you and is not really your enemy it is yours and yours alone. But so many of us deal with this everyday and im sure many others have stated that you are not alone but i understand that you cant escape it. You can't escape it unless you fight back im not talking about drinking or having fun with your gf but to fight against that depression. Even if you get tired of it even if you feel that you cant deal with it keep pushing so you dont go down easily. You may believe that you are alone and naturally you want to be alone for some odd reason that you feel like no one will understand but believe me people do understand.
Well... I get that feeling too. But in my case it's rather that I feel locked up inside myself and Idk. I just feel far far away. The thing I did to make it better is attend a therapy (i'm still in it). It helped talking about it. I got a big group of firends. They are wonderful, but sadly I'm not that close to them as they are between them (bc of my "little problems"). I finally opened up to them, talked about my problems and everything. I wasn't really specific. But i it actually helped me a lot. I always say; a girlfriend/boyfriend is someone special, someone who you trust. You always want him/her to be open with you. To talk to you. I think your gf may have the feeling that she is losing you. And maybe you should try to talk to her. You could just... tell her that you feel like she doesn't love you and that she wants to leave you. Tell her that you are really sorry but that you have some troubles being open. You should really talk to the people around you about it, bc if you don't, then they won't be able to help you. If your gf was in the same situation as you are, you would like her to talk about it too, wouldn't you? Pls try to have a conversation about it (not a fight)
You feel lonely because honestly, your'e searching too hard. Seeking friendship or companionship is not the way to go. It's like people who seek love never find it, but only encounter it when they least expect it. You're a cute girl. You will find somone who you can share memories and ife changing experiences with. Just don't try, only just be the best you you can be.
In Dying Need Of Help.

Any Help Would Be Nice
Thanks To Anyone Who Replys
Today my mother said to me horrible things just because I use black lipstic and black clothes and I have an emo hair cut. She want that I change myself but I will never change because I'M EMO and she can't do it to me. I want to be myself not a doll of my mother. Help please!!!! I'm desperate!!!!
Just stay true to yourself she cant change who you are
Listen to me, if your mother does not appreciate you, then don't yearn for her approval.
I have the same problem. But my mother keeps putting religion in to "back her up"
Why religion? Was Jesus emo and that's why God killed him? XD If anyone uses religion as an excuse to change a human being, then they're ignorant as fuck.
Thank you all for the advices. Hugs :)
its just a little phase is all 
Be yourself !
This is sad, but you just have to handle the situation until you can live alone. I'm suffering from that myself. My parents won't chango. Hope your mother does... *hugs*
I know exactly what you are going through,hun. My mother is the same way. All I can stay is to be yourself,she doesn't have to accept it. Some people's minds aren't going to change anytime soon. Why does she get the right to judge her own daughter for expressing herself? Nobody knows you better than you know yourself. Keep being awesome.
No joke I've think we've literally all gone through this so you're not alone. But I've been into "alternative"  all my life but only got into it when i was 10/11 and I currently just turned 15 and my parents are only accepting it now so give it some time.
My entire family mocks me for being emo.
your parents are fools.
That's weird, my mum accepted me from day one. My dad didn't though, so I just ignored him, he'll get over it eventually.
Same :/
You live under their roof and have to tone it down until you hit 18.
You may not like it but unfortunately that's how it is xD
I don't believe in stereotypes but I was "Goth" at 14 and my parents were fine with it.
My dad just wouldn't allow black lipstick or dyed black hair.
Other then that - I was allowed fishnet, combat boots and basically. What I wanted.
Everyone has their own tastes and style and parents are just looking out for your own interest.
I know it doesn't seem like it at a young age, trust me. I fought with my parents tooth and nail.
Though now being 20. I actually see what they meant.
Just ask your parents what you can and cant wear/have and come to an agreement.
Cause you do have the right to dress how you want but till your an adult xD
They are allowed to say no lol

I guess they think like good family members should live as normal and modern as they can so they can't accept someone with unusual thoughts and look.i mean it's fine.u don't have to bother your self,they'll slowly give it up.like...when they can't fix it,they let go.so don't worry it'll be fine

I've had an abusive dad for years. My mother disowned me so I'm stuck with him. I starve myself, cut, and i drink to get away from it all. Probably doesn't help that I pill pop either. I have heart problems and i want to die. Things just can't get easier for me and the bullies are getting worse. I just can't do it anymore....
Ik how that feels but like Alana said don't let him get to you. Call someone if you need to. Hell when I was being abused I just moved out and told my abuser fuck off. Hell if he don't let you and nobody can help I really hate to say it even if he's your dad hit him back. But use that as a last resort. Don't do it unless you have too. Ik its not the best advice but your dad is probably just a coward and can't take that your better than him(to me anyone who is abusive sucks ass) if you need anything hmu homie whoop whoop and much love to ya
I have never told anyone about this but now I'm coming out about this. I always have visions about me or loved ones getting killed. Is anyone else exeriencing this?
You're just edgy. Don't worry, though, it's just a phase, it'll pass
Because unwanted visions are what make you edgy.
Trust me dude its crazy but the weird thing is they end. I have the same thing but mainly I just see people I dislike getting murdered. Its not that weird but if you feel you need help get some dude it's ok

i noticed that all emos like batman , but i think it's just because andy biersack love him? anyone agree
Well i like Jack Skellington so...
I prefer the Joker
I like jack skellington
I always liked batman as a kid and still do. I mean he's bad ass.
So I was engaged... I was with him for 8 years. I'm 22 he's 21. He dumped me recently because I caught him sleeping with and calling a 17 year old girl his girlfriend. I still love him even though we aren't together we still live together we still do "things" together. He's a piece of crap but something is preventing me from doing anything about our situation. I fucking love him and it's ripping me to shreds. I don't know what to do...
Kill yourself. It's the only way.

hey i'm 15 years i wanna move to the usa to meet my gf and internet frineds , i can't live here in algeria because it's so sucks to be alone and hated by everyone here , mom told me that she will give me money to travel , but is it hard to get visa and is it hard to live there?
I am 17 years old and have been dressing androgynous since I was 13. I still identify as female and use she/her pronouns. I recently came out as bisexual to almost everyone I know and have been trying to stretch my gender norms a bit more. But my mom, even though she says she accepts me, and I kind of believe her, she means well, is a bit concerned. She has this notion that me being myself is going to somehow endanger my family. See, I have two little brothers and she thinks they are going to be ridiculed or harmed because their older sister dresses like a dude. Which, has not happened. Nobody has gone out of their way to make mine or my family's life harder. In terms of my gender expression, I find myself identifying with somewhere between STEM-STUD. I've tried explaining this to my mom, using the simplest words possible. She told me she doesn't want me looking butch even though I already am. I haven't brought up the technical terms of androgynous or gender-fluid but she knows it has something to do with my sexual identity. I know if I bring it up again and it's just going to cause another arguemt. It feels like the elephant in the room and it's causing a slight rift in our relationship. And it's not like I'm jumping straight into it, she already let's me wear my hair in a bun and wear a beanie to make me look more masculine. She even let me shave the back of my head where it can be covered up with layers. I was misgendered before I was out of the closet, now I don't mind so much. But she doesn't want me to be misgendered period. Understand I didn't grow up in a homophobic, genderphobic household, my mom is just concerced about my own well-being and safety. I just don't see how I can get her to let go of her fear and let me make this decision. I want her to see that I AM being myself and not just trying to cause a huge ruckus or look like some of my favorite icons. That this is something, in my eyes, that I need. 
XXX
So, does this mean you have a dick?
^Um? What? Did you even bother reading any of this? Do you think 'androgynous' is just another word for transgender or? It literally just means she dresses neither girly nor masculine.

was just asking a simple question to learn more about the subject. I didn't knew it was taboo to talk about it, I guess we should just throw the subject in the river and never talk about it again since it's so offensive asking question ^^.
Your question made it sound like you read the first two sentences and jumped to a conclusion.
more it is your judgement that was quick and with a lack of second thought about a very simple question that was asked
Like my sibling. They identify as genderqueer. Our family won't even talk about it, my sibling got up all the courage in the world to tell them too. Know the struggles
so now I have another question, and don't be offended please I'm just curious, what is a genderqueer? is it something like a trans? or not?
My sibling doesn't feel right in their biological body and doesn't identify with it, like trans. But at the same time doesn't identify as the opposite. ''Kinda both kinda neither''
Do you think it could be some sort of psychological problem which is causing that issue? Or maybe it could be hormonal?
No. I grew up with this person, they have been like it all their life, just didn't know there was a word for it.
people who are bipolar are also born like this. I'm just saying this in a contextual order, maybe she should identifiate what it is to help them appropriately?
I'm just seeing that a lot of them seems to be having problems. And I was reading this article about people who wants to change sex, a huge majority of them who end doing the operation end in suicide in the next year, so much that some doctors actually refuse to do this sort of operation now, I'm just addressing issues.
They obviously have their problems, sadly those are the stories that get written about and I'm sorry that they feel that way, but that isn't my sibling. Even with our parents who refuse to listen, my sibling is still strong enough to carry on and be who they are and express in the way they want to.
@FooFoo no, I don't want a dick. :p :) I prefer to dress in a way that is either more masculine or gender-neutral. Gender neutral can be defined as either male nor female. I still identify though as a girl. No, I do not think your gender or sexuality may stem from mental issues but dysphoria can cause depression or suicidal tendencies. I still identify as a girl, just a more masculine or fluid girl.
I think being genderqueer is sort of like identifying as a gender-neutral person rather than just expressing those feelings and still identifying as the binary-sex. (Male or Female)
My sibling is looking at binary in the rear view mirror. lol
Why is it such a big deal what people identify as who the fuck cares.
well I do care, because I'm interested in what people think or what they are going through or what difficulties they are facing. I care because I want to know if they are hurt...
thank you. any advice on how to deal with my mom?
It's really up to you.You're old enough to make your own decisions and you shouldn't let your parents tell you how to live your life.They want you to go to college because they think its best for you, but whats the point of life if you cant do what you truly love and hate every single day you're alive because your parents think its best for you
It's YOUR life, not your parents life. Your an adult now so you're old enough to make your own decisions.
Hello :( I'm James
I wish to tell you all about something that happened.

About a month ago, I started talking to this girl online, she was amazing and we got on like a house on fire. We were perfect together, I then invited her over to my house, where we planned to do all sorts of things. We cuddled, kissed, I tried weed, and we ended up in bed together. This was all pretty big to me as I'm socially awkward and I'd never done anything of the sort before. 
The next day, I'd found that she had blocked me from all forms of social media with no way to contact her :(
This made me really upset.
Well I suppose you ran into a gold digger. You'll feel better after stuffing your face with pizza and watching Edward scirrorhands.
That's fucked up dude o_o
It could be worst. You could end up and bed and realise that she got a penis
Yeah :/ It really sucks, she knew I was nervous and it was my first time doing all of that stuff. 
Yeah xD I'm glad she didn't, that would be a shock
Wow thats messed up i would never do that to someone if you need a good friend im here
I'm Avery. I was never bullied at school but the feeling that they were only there in times that you are whole and they can suck the hell of all the things they can get from you. They call themselves my friends and even brag me with the rest in school. Then whenever I fail and commit something wrong they wore smiles of sympathy and understanding for me but behind me they speak of me as if I had never done anything right. The main reason why they have two faces is because they want to hook up with my brothers. But unfortunately my brothers couldn't care less. They're not players and they have happy relationships. And another thing probably because I am a bookworm/geek/achiever. The bad trait I think that I have is that I easily trust people. Until I find out one day that they were just merrily using me to get up in the heirarchy. Then they'll leave me and be happily bitches while me I turn to a loser rag thrown outside.
Bookworm geek achiever? That's great. I love smart people and if someone cant see how special and great u r they can take a flying leap
Thanks. But I don't waste my time for them anymore.
Why do some people seem to always have good stuff going for them? My Facebook friends are all getting married, getting jobs, and graduating from college and here I am single, living with mom, and a drop out, which I've been keeping secret for the past 6 months. I don't have a car, job, or friends to hang out with. I can't get laid easy because I can only use the car on certain days and can't travel far from home or be gone long. Hell it feels like I'm in prison. I was voted most likely to succeed in high school, but I haven't succeeded at nothing. I'm to the point where I don't care anymore. I'm just going to go find a job at pizza hut.
Why did you drop out of school ? There's no such thing as fair life.You're the only one responsible for your life and you shouldnt just sit and wait for friends and girlfriend to come at your house door.All your FB friends have 1 thing in common.They all made great effort to get things they wanted (diploma,job,marriage).It didnt just fall off the sky
So stop feeling sorry for yourself and get the fuck out of your room and do something with your life
I'm just so discouraged.......I dropped out because I wasn't passing and because I was just getting myself more and more in debt. And I already tried to do something with my life. I worked my butt off for 3+ years trying to get a diploma, trying to find a decent job, and trying to find that special someone, but it looks like I'm just not meant to have those things. Maybe I'm not "blessed" like other people are. And the reason I say life is unfair is because sometimes it seems like no matter how hard you try, if you're not lucky enough (or in the right place at the right time, or saying and doing the right stuff at the right time, or you're not born a certain way and have a certain personality), then you might never get the things you want. At least not as easy as other people.
I seriously don't know what to do with my life.. but maybe I'll figure something out...
Life is pointless. We spend all our life working for the future. We go to school to get a job, we get a job to pay for retirement, then we die. Everything we do is a time filler till we die. Anything we leave behind (music, book, cures, ect...) is only to help other people fill the time before THEY die. Sorry if this offends anyone, I'm just getting stuff off my mind

you're too young to know the meaning of life yet. Life is really precious and you should spend it wisely.
I've been thinking life was pointless since 18.. Adopt a YOLO attitude.
Life has its ups and downs. You're just on a down right now. Life is really what you make of it, you'll  have better days.
When Accepting Or Declineing A Friend Request It Shows Up Invalid Data.. Only Way To Accept Is To Go The Page That Sent You The Friend Request.. So thier is no way of declineing any request
So basically I'm 18 now and I'm getting a lot of people telling me I'm immature or cringeworthy because I still love the emo/scene style.
Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with judgement?

Wow I have to say your post was very helpful and enlightening :) I don't feel so alone either.
My mom has always been obsessed with preppier looks so as you can imagine, whenever I choose to express myself she always looks down on me so I can relate! Thats one good thing about being an adult now is I can do what I want
Well consider this. Emo subculture was the big thing in the early 2000s. Some people who were emo 10 years ago when they were, say, 14, still consider themselves emo at 24.
I'm honestly starting to grow out of it (I'm getting more into goth culture instead) but that's just me. You do you.
Thank you for your insight! it means a lot :)
I'm spiderman ;-;

No problem x3

You don't need a man.
You're not doing anything wrong, maybe it's just not your time yet. Wait some weeks, months perhaps years. I've dated many people in my life and i regret hurting people or getting hurt. Sometimes it's the best to stay away from love for it can do horrible things to you...

^Don't get me wrong having a boyfriend is probably very nice, but it's not necessary.
To be honest if he is going around seeing other girls, not talking to you when it suits him and being a dick then he doesnt deserve you. If you value your friendship with him then work with him to make it better. But if he doesnt appreciate your loyalty or friendship i say fuck him. There are plenty more people out there that will treat you well instead of this guy whose playing on your feelings/ emotions.
The way I see it things are simple.He might believe that he has you at his pinky and might take you for granted.Either that or he's just bored (that's why he still talks with you) or frustrated, making things up so he will have a reason to argue with you.My advice, ignore him and think of yourself and what's healty for you.
Hi I have PTSD as well and use to hear voices but I still sometimes have mild hallucinations or alter things on my mind
I know all to well that feeling.
It sucks and makes you question basically life :(

Agreed! Lets chat CX
Lol we have serious mental conditions! We should chat! XD
Ok :)
is there any emo slang?
Well, "I'm gonna slit my wrists" usually means "i'm out" or thereabouts yano?
I came up with "well cut my wrists and black my eyes!" as a reaction but haven't gotten anyone else to use it lol
lol i need to use tha

I love the song that that comes from
Im always the one with the answers. I go out of my way to help people.  I'm nice to everyone I meet and I try not to discriminate.  But I don't help myself.  I'm not even nice to myself.  I criticize myself everytime I look at myself . Yet I keep this hate and saddness deep down. I cover it with a fake smile. I help others while inside...I'm drowning...inside I'm screaming out for someone...someone to help me like I help everyone else. But who would every know that I go to sleep crying...because it turns out...I'm really good at lying.
P.S if u ever feel down feel free to msg me :3
Thanks darlin
-huggles back- ty dear. And just the kindness and understanding helps.
Its hard to take our own advice sometimes. Just think of what you would suggest to one of your friends, and that is what you should do. Everyone needs someone to talk to at times, and the opportunity to share feelings and feel vulnerable. No one should have to take the burden of everyone elses problems without addressing their own. Anyways, hope you are feeling better. =].
...What?
Professional help is always an option, one thing though is that you'll need to not only learn to stop lying to others (especially if you're seeing someone for it), but as well as to stop lying to yourself. Admiting things to oneself can be quite difficult but can be done, admiting it to others is probably even more difficult but can be done slowly and to the right people, people who are willing and let alone wanting to listen.
...but if we can't talk, what's the point of joining? If that happens, people will get frustrated and leave the site.

Im having issues with trying to find someone who will accept me for me. Ive tried being me,being like other people,giving up what i love what should i do?
Maybe you're just a twat and nobody like you for you.
That was rude ^
Hun just be you. If they can't accept you for you then they're not worth having around. The right people will come along, just keep your head up ^^

You're listing all these things which your capable of, but capability to withstand such conditions barely affects your personality.
And you're judging someone without even knowing them so what's that say about YOUR personality? :')
My personality has no role in this argument.
Just take a quick swig of bleach
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
Can't say I have ur alone  you should end it all
OK so I have two different styles and personalities but idk which to go with and now I constantly get confused and frustrated with it. And I honestly don't know what to do
Why pick one? Both are your personalities...both make you you.
They are polar opposites of each other
Care to elaborate?
One is a personality I had created because I no longer felt like my original personality fit me so I molded a new personality around the alternative style and now both of them keeps popping up
Which one makes you feel more you? Like in which persona are you more comfortable in?
Tell them to fuck off. Easy as A-B-C.
you gotta take some time and mourn over your loss
Yeah, but my friends don't understand that I need time, and keep trying to get me to go on dates, and have even set me up for a blind date recently
Yeah, I plan on not going on any blind dates or otherwise until either I move out for school in the fall, or maybe even after I graduate. (about 1.5-2 years) I won't be able to handle being hurt like that again. And I've been trying to work out/go running more since he broke up with me. I was going running, but I've been trying to go more. And thank you for the advice. One of the things I kind of want to do is once I turn 21 in about 4.5 weeks (May 2) I want to go out and go crazy and get super fucked up. I'm planning on going with two or three close friends. I know it's probably not the best idea, but I just want to go out and have fun and not worry about anything. I wont be able to do it on my actual birthday since it's on a monday and I have class for another 2 weeks after (May 12 is my last class). So I'll either go out the weekend after my birthday or the following weekend at the very end of the semester.
I loved this girl alot,she would tell me that she loved me and I would stay up all night just to talk to her and I come to find out she used me and she loved someone else,she blocked me and told me she loved someone else :'( how can I avoid that
1) don't go on the internet.
2) don't interact with people.
3) stay alone your entire life.
believe me, you won't get used if you follow these steps. Good luck !!1! (^;;
^ do this
That's one way to do it...
Never trust people online,
Never let your guard down,
Never let yourself fall for anyone online...
Most of the time they aren't who they say they are, or they are just on to flirt around...
The best thing you can do in your youth is keep away from relationships in general...
It sounds cheesy...
But ignore all of that and study hard, you will find real people in due time,
You may trip over quite a lot of stupid people.
That's what life is full of, speed bumps,
As long as you keep focused on your goals, I'm confident you will come out on top.
DON'T BE A SLUT.
idk I never get used but I always have the best friends so really you just need good discernment with people. pick up on vibes n shit. if anyone gives you any kind of uneasy feeling then chances are you do not wanna be around them.
Need help deciding on the colours

Green.

I know how and have successfully pierced my ear before, but im wondering, does anyone know if you can use SMALL hooped earings(sleeper size) in your lip?
Don't do it. Please get it done professionally. In case anything happens badly, trust me from experience. I did my snake bites sophomore year ended up super bad. Now that I got them done by a piercer no problems. Just my advice. (:
Tuesday was my first day of high school. I haven't been to school in four years. I lasted two days then quit. My parents try to help and so do my friends, but nothing seems to work anymore. I've basically stopped feeling, so to feel I cut. Any suggestions?
I'm really sorry For you ,but you are strong ,you can do it 
Well, i can't really do much... But, you know,  people is stupid, so forget them. If you want a friend, here I am.
LOLNO. INTERNET FRIENDS AREN'T FRIENDS.

Not up to you to decide, mr "I'm better than everyone on this site". Who OTHERS consider to be friends isn't your decision.
THEY JUST DELUDE THEMSELVES INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY'RE FRINDS BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH EVERONE HERE IS A LONER.
All of you are amazing, just keep your head up and smile. I am here for all of you. It might seem hard but it will get easier. Maybe not right away though but it will get bettter. Love you all Hugs.
BetterOffDead said:

Yes, it is.
NOOOOOO
It's completely fabricated.
Why you say that?
Because all statements such as these are fabricated. Common sense.
I want to get snake bites (lip piercings) but i'm not sure - also I don't think my parents will let me, any advice? :)
IF YOUR PARENTS WON'T ALLOW YOU TO GET THEM, DON'T FUCKING GET THEM. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
You probably shouldn't listen to Kassidy or I, but I would have pierced my own lips if my parents would have told me no xD
Okay, so I'm going to step in right now and say don't do them yourself, considering most people don't take the proper steps to ensure that it will heal properly (if you did, all the power to you) especially when you want snakebites, which are a symmetrical piercing. It's way safer to get it done at a studio because it's sterile, has the proper jewelry, and is done with a proper hollowpoint needle instead of punching through the skin with a pointed tip of say, a sewing needle or safety pin.If you want them, go for it. If you're worried about pain, lip piercings only feel like a quick pinch. They're no worse than ear piercings in my opinion. Make sure you do the proper research so you understand what kind of healing process it'll be and the smartest ways to look after the piercing wounds while they heal. It's not hard to keep a new piercing disinfected, because it'll scar or reject the piercing if you let it get infected during the healing process. If your parents don't want you to get a piercing, it's really up to your own judgment whether or not to go against them. Some parents will relent and accept that their kid has done something rebellious, other times their life becomes a living hell. Use your own descretion.
My personal advice and from my own experience, just get them done professionally. I did mine myself when I was a freshman. Big mistake. Now that a professional piercer did mine, nothing happened. No problems. 
If parents won't let you, wait until you're 18. Quite simple as that. 
Hopefully you'll take my advice.
I did my lip myself and it was painless and had no promlems afterwards. doesnt always go that well though :3
If you're 18, then your parents really can't do anything about it. If you feel that you belong with your fiance and her family, that is your choice as an adult.

The worst they can do, I imagine, is cut you off from whatever they may be offering you. If that is an issue, you should address it. Weigh the consequences of leaving suddenly and abrutly.

It is your life, and your choice, and your business. You have to do what you feel is right.
As someone who lives on their own I'll give you all my advice...
1. Live with your parents as long as they will let you...
Unless you have a steady job and income, which usually means working long hours at a minimum wage job or working a full time job that pays well but sucks, and being 18 I am guess you are a high school student so that means you are not gaureteed a decent job unless you have skills...you have grocery bills, doctor bills, insurance to pay for said doctor bills, if you have a car you have to pay for gas, insurance, registration, inspection, any repairs, you have utility bills gas and electric, you have phone bill, you have rent, and you have to buy clothes and nessecities like bath supplies, cleaning supplies. the cost of living is expensive if you are on your own. Living with your parents might be bad but I wish I could have stayed with mine as long as possible despite everything they put me through. You think following the rules is hard but you have no idea, what hard is. You said you your family is privileged so I am guessing you don't know how to survive on the your own very well or without getting what you want...You distance yourself from your family and you're out on your own, with no one, and if shit happens you are up a creek without a paddle.
If you really have to move
2. Don't trust anyone...
at 18 you may think you are in love or you have friends...but when shit happens people turn a blind eye and you are left standing in the dust. They will screw you over. When you go out on your own and people suddenly become "unavailable" when you need them. If you distance your self from your family you might as well say goodbye to the only true friends you have. Your family may be tough or harsh or hard to live with, but they will always have your back, your friends will not.
3. Learn to live with the bare essentials.
When you first move out, you have nothing, and it takes a while to get anything, parents will usually make sure you are okay, as much as you may think they treat you badly, they are not going to send you out there unstable. You may find yourself in a shitty appartment on an air mattressat at first if you don't know make a mistake. People think living on their own is a dream but you have to realize in your parents house, you have a secure thing, people to support you, when you are on your own, you are ON YOUR OWN. There is no going back.
Hey Ekko can you PM or write a reply here? 
I need help making some decitions on stuff to take on this topic.
And need help ASAP please. Moving within this month
I know.

I have to get outta this house. My step mother abuses and harrasses me. And the rest of my family turns a blind eye to it.

The person I'm moving in with is good. She treats me not only as a actual human but as her own son.
Hopefully it all works out.
If you turn 18 you van do whatever ur feelin with no reprocusions comerade but my best advice is live slow take life slow i wanted to do the same when i was a kid and now i regret growing up so fast. i was engaged at 16-18 my relationship ended im just saying be carful and id wait a little while see how everything turns out.

Faq, ive never been this depressed in my life. I just wanna.... naw... Ive already gone to treatment once for various things and I dont want to go again. My family thinks im a satanist lesbian cross. Obviously they dont understand. I have no friends. What should I do???
My family thinks im a satanist lesbian cross
-insert holy bible here-
stay strong
Wut?
I'm pansexual and my parents won't accept it.... Can I get some advice here?! Like, they aren't being total dick heads they're just denying it.
Does it matter? Let them deny because regardless of who accepts or denys the fact doesn't define who you are. I'm Bi-sexual and when I came out to my parents a couple years ago - they shrugged it off and told me until I get married. Then I'd know if I was straight or lesbian. Though that's not how it works. Just because I haven't dated a female yet - doesn't mean I'm not bi-sexual. It means I haven't found a female I'm interested in yet and even if I married a male. I'm going to continue being attracthed to woman.
You will get people in your life who won't accept your sexuality and others who will. Just accept they won't accept it and move on cause you know yourself.
I have the same situation at my home, but after the first couple of lectures I just Started ignoring it.
ahhh pansexuality...the ignored sexuality. You guys get shit on by homophobes AND other LGBTQ. 

You're valid. You are not trying to be special, you didn't make up an unrealistic sexuality just to be different so fuck anyone who tells you that crap.

Your parents have no right to define YOUR sexuality for you. Nobody knows it better than you, nobody should act like they're allowed to dictate your sexuality for you.

I kek'd. Anyone who says they're pansexual is bisexual, but want to look more special.
Why don't you just delete your account. We really don't need your negativity.

Bisexuality is sexual attraction to men and women. Pansexuality is attraction to anyone regardless of gender identity or expression. Pansexuals can be attracted to people who identify outside the gender binary. The basic fact is that gender doesn't play a role in their attraction while it does for bi people.

Things you don't understand aren't automatically bullshit. Peace.

Did I fucking stutter? 

You can't dictate to other people what THEIR sexual orientation is. Nobody knows it better than them. Besides, others' sexualities has no effect on your life. No middle school kid has any need to be so damn salty about how other people live their life. Get your head out of your ass, be open minded.

You're implying I don't understand. Fucking listen to me, it's bisexuality. Bisexuality is attraction to mean and women. That's what pansexuality is, as well. They are equal. Except pansexuality makes someone look more special, that is all.

Hey guys does anybody know how to tag people on this site, I googled it and I got no resultes .
So if anybody knows how please tell me It would be a big help thank's.
There use to be a function where you could tag people right before the website crahed but they haven't updated it to do that again :/
Aww well thanks for the info.
Do you know when they might update it to tag people again?
No idea :/ i thought they would've by now
Lol well that's ok, thank you for the help it is most apperciated. :)
Anytime :)
I found out the other day that the guy I had a crush on was only pretending to like me cause "he was trying to be nice" it has made me feel so worthless I wish I was pretty maybe he would like me then but its not the first time this has happened with someone. I guess I can't be loved I think I was just made to linger here I think I was mother natures worst mistake I think I was made very different to others in the way that I can not be loved
Well unfortunately you must just have a bad pick of the dude-lot. I'm sure you can be loved and I really hope you find it too. If that's really you in your profile picture then you're really pretty and super cute. Also, from reading your profile, you seem to be fairly intelligent, so I think you just have a weak or immature guy population you are choosing from. All seems well to me and I'm pretty confident that you'll be able to find love :)
If he doesn't want ya, what makes you think mother nature will?
Life is too short to worry about having a partner. At teenage years, go wild with close friends. Appreciate family while you still can! And make the most of your schooling! When you get older and realized you had a fair deal of good memories, and are ready and mature for a boy, try then, the boys at your age are still bragging about how "They can get the most pussy" or whatever, eventually we grow up to be "I wanna make her happy and loved". I know I grew up from being a dumb child to an adult. Maybe appreciate the love of friends and family and then focus on romance once you have everything stable :3
okay so i was 61 days clean of cutting but i relapsed this morning... i feel like such a failure to all the people i made promises to... how can i hate myself a litle less for this
You've actually done well, 61 days is a lot. I'm up to about 70 days now as well. You have to be proud of yourself, even though you relapsed, you can keep trying and trying until you succees. build it up, it's a long and hard process but I know you can do it!
So today at school I needed to go to a different school and there was this group of people that where students in that school. They where older from me. So I had some kind of a 'discussion' with them. It has nothing to do with the issue... So I noticed that there was a guy that played a guitar. He had black hair and bangs. He kept on looking at me. Later on when we needed to leave I think he smiled at me... I don't really know. He looked in my direction and smiled... And since then I can't stop thinking about it!! I have a massive headache, I feel like crying and generally like shit... I don't know what to do...
So I don't get it. I'm just confused reading your post. A stranger smiled at you and you got headache and feel like crying?
basically i got a crush on that guy and then i felt that way.
Well next time just walk to him and introduce yourself and get to know him as if you just want to be friends. I think most of the guy would think that's sexy. You never know, he might has a crush on you as well. Good luck!
No reason to panic. If you see him again say hi. If he is interested at all he will take the conversation from there.
Sounds like you're developing a crush on him. But it seems like he's noticing you, just smile back next time and say hi. Take a step forward!
welcome to Australia, i hope he is as keen as you to have here.
Remember to stay strong ^.^/
Stay strong, move on..
Wise words!! :D
clever lass
I understand what you mean and I agree, but when people cut their minds are in a different place. It's hard to think straight at the time, as the stress is in one big pile and when they cut endorphins are sometimes released. It's only temporily and afterwards they feel awful and are full of regret. It is also very hard to stop and can become addictive to some people. Another thing I would want to point out is not everybody has someone around them to talk to. People without friends and abused kids don't exactly have someone to talk to in most cases. But overall, you a right in what you are saying. Victims of bullying should never keep it in when there is someone to talk to and bullies really need to think about their selfish and careless actions. Bullying is just too common these days.
Anyone from georgia?
In a matter of two weeks I've had several friends communicate to me through fb or text telling me they had suicidal thoughts and were about to act. 
I've had to deal with this so many times in my life and I guess people just feel comfortable coming to me before they do something that will affect everyone's lives, but honestly it's really draining mentally and spiritually. After I almost killed myself when I OD'd on pills and alcohol for months I decided to become numb to people's problems and drama but there's still those closest to me I just can't do that to. The second girl I ever loved and my best friend's in both Idaho and Georgia need me and I can't let my emotional detachment cloud my judgment. I'm not lying anymore I'm not ok and I feel the depression set in and anxiety of what might happen..
Ti you can talk to me * hugs * I am always here for you
I know, it's like there's things I can tell you because I trust you and know you can help then there's things I don't even know how to explain so how could anyone help me with them you know?..

Hi there,
My name is Echo, and I make problems go away. A problem solver, if you will. List your problems below, and I will help, although admittedly, you'll have to do some of the work
Ive been trying to find a way to tell my mom 
Im pansexual but I just found out my mom has 
Cancer..... and im just to afraid of my dad because
He beat me and my siblings as we grew up.. I mean he is taking antidepressants like me. but I just cant shake the fear u know?.. and my little brother always tells my mom every thing I tell him. And mt sister the one person I could go to left my life...so ya I dont know what to do with my life anymore... I have aready been to a mental hospital.
Maybe don't tell them until you are ready. Just wait for a bit. For now just talk to us online, we are always here to help. I hope your mum recovers soon! If you ever need anyone to talk to, feel free to talk to me (:
Thx
Here's the thing: you don't have to tell your parents. If they aren't going to approve, then why do they need to know? I've never came out to anyone, not even my irl friends. I just know to myself that when I'm out of the house, I can do anything I want, date anyone I want ect.
I'm a very wise man and sort of a problem solver if anyone needs help
I'm a very wise man and sort of a problem solver if anyone needs help
I honsetly think you should listen to your mom because if she charges him with kidnapping it will kindnapping it will kinda ruin your whole situation.If he really loves you he'll be able to wait. Hope this helps.

thank you for one being honest and two being helpful.
If you're both adults, then she can't really charge him of kidnapping...
I'm only 16
I think you should wait tell your 18 if he loves you he'll wait  don't think you want him going to jail =)
Forgot the i lol
I was in a situation like this 2 years ago XD wait till your 16, Two years suck, but he could get 10 years for kidnapping.
lets see, your prolly seventeen by now, just one year if you two still are determined
I know this is fucking stupid but people hate me because of what i say but don't have intentions of hurting
I just ended insulted without knowing I insulted them before.
I feel more suicidal.
my dad has attempted suicide multiple times. last year he was almost successful and was on life support for a while. it sucks
if your looking for friends you can be my friend if you want, I wanted to post this, if you going thru a hard time right now, just remember to Stay Strong 
That actually made my day the slightest bit better c:
thats good im here for u if u wanna talk
this post really made my day...ive had a really crappy week so thank you :)
That made my day c: thanks
... shortly I've been happy with my "problem". Without manic attacks I would live in self-harm and pain. But in fact, usually, when I'm somewhere to order things, I laugh in wrong time and in wrong place. Still trying to stay calm. 

I have also problems to talk with people, those serious ones. And guess the feeling, when they got pissed and You don't naturally mean anything bad... it does sucks on sometimes and I have to wthink long time before I say something. I kinda Guard myself and it takes my all powers from the day. I still can't be worried, exept if there is someone who doesn't really know what the bipolar disorder is...
And? Take your meds and move on with life.
i don't have a medicure c: so i'm fine. Its just their problem, not mine. But im fine with Your opinion, cuz its not from everyone.
If you're diagnosed bipolar like you claim, then you'd be on some form of medication. It's not an opinion, it's fact.
Source: Me. I'm diagnosed type 2 bipolar
That medicine what they did give me almost did kill me. Of course, if you say so what gives You the better life, is good for You, but if those would to make You anguished, heart attacks or cancer for example, would You still take them?
They obviously gave you the wrong cocktail. Try again. If at first you don't succeed...(Then EOD is not for you). and Yes, I would take them still. I already smoke and drink heavily so how would it be any different?
I tried 5 years and quitted many of those. I can't say what is the worse, but the experience made me feel to avoid those medicines. So now I take just melatonin and doing sports? 

You may have better genes to tolerate things maybe what some people can't, 

I still have not problems (suicidal, self-harm thoughts), though I would to imagine something to make happen.
STAY STRONG 
Ty Stevie c:
your welcome :)
I'm a 20 year old trans boy who has quite a bit of issues. I get triggered by drugs(mostly being around people who smoke weed), I can't stand people who drink constantly(alcoholism is a trait I'm far too firmiliar with). Also I can't stand people who are on their phones instead of talking to the people they are with. I won't even waste money on a smart phone because there's no point in wasting 80 bucks on something I won't even use. Most social media is garbage and it makes me angry. Am I the only one?
Absolutely not the only one. Drugs bother me as well, and so does drinking. And, people who are constantly on their phone bother me as well. I can empathize one hundred percent.
that triggered me
I know this is fucking stupid but people hate me because of what i say but don't have intentions of hurting
I just ended insulted without knowing I insulted them before.
I feel more suicidal.
Hang in there, not literally but yeah you know what I mean. I know how you feel I'm brutally honest so the feels are mutual.
Try to think before talking ;-;
Everyone of you I am here for you. I have been in most of your problems. I understand what you are going through. If you need to talk I am here for if you need a hug I will be waiting for you with open arms. I will care for you even if you hurt me. Just message me or kik me its hatelove177. 
I'm proud of you Nikkia. I hope you have nice life, you deserve the world. You're a great person.
Awww thank you. So do you
this seems to be the only website i have never been harrased on, there was this one website that i liked to use but some bad people on there have forced me to deleate my account. if it's helpful maybe you can share your bad experiences of the web with this post?
my opinion on social media, Don't put too much details of your personnal life on these, because some people could use it against you. Avoid putting to much picture of yourself or your entourage for the same reasons.
Uh honestly, you're scrutinizing this WAY too much. Chill.

And...if you forget your password you can literally have it emailed to you...why would you need to make a whole new account?
-When you make a post you have the option to add a link to it.

-Nobody will notice if you lie about who you are, the admins can't see you through the screen.

-They aren't strict, they never even post. The last major thing they did was shut down an account that some guy hacked and used to cyberbully. 

Basically, as long as you're not an asshole there's no reason for you to get banned. By the way, it's pretty damn hard to "insult someone without realizing".
Social network is so simple. People make it hard
Ok so I notice that some people have background photos, and I assume this was done with a CSS code. I don't really know much about CSS besides adding username colors on wikia, so can someone tell me what the CSS code would be for adding a background image? Here's the image I want.
i wish i knew

I feel like i'm pushing people away, and poeple get really annoyed when I won't give them my personal information, or skype them or something. My relationships have failed because of trust issues. I just want someone who I can really TRUST. Is that too much to ask? I don't even trust my own parents...
Well I will give you an olive branch here and be honest with you. I feel that you got your feelings fucked. Something had to happen to you that effected you mentally and told you that you can't trust people. Maybe you were mistreated as a child maybe you are bullied and were betrayed by a friend but Trust is a very hard bond to have with just anyone. Yet you want help you are shouting out here to get some honest feed back and Honesty is one of the main foundations of any kind of trust. You hardly revealed anything of yourself here and yeah you dont trust people and you are afraid of the pain of being betrayed but you wont ever heal it if you dont learn how to deal with the pain and move on past these issues. If you can trust anyone trust the Honest Stranger who isn't pulling his punches.
I know how you feel. I'm going to therpy for depression and trust issues actually and it's really hard to even open up to my therapist(s). And the worst thing are these "i don't trust anyone"-people that just say it because they wanna be mysterious (I'm not saying that you are. I'm saying that these kind of people, u sure know a few, just make it harder). I push people away from me too. Well... Normally I don't even talk to them so I can't really... Push them away. What helps me is an "alternative therapy" where they try to search the reason for it. It's really weired bc it helps, even if I didn't expected it to work. It make me open up like a fool for a few days and then I "get bad again" and have to go back.
She's amazing. She's beautiful, funny, cute, her smiles brightens my world, her eyes are a goregous hazel when the sun hits them just right. It's stunning. She's not into me at all, and it's not like she doesn't know I'm into her. Although, I don't think she knows the extent. She's such a tease too. She likes to grab me and pretend to kiss me, and she likes to sleep on my shoulder occasionally. I don't do anything when that stuff happens because I know she's not into me. I feel like if I put my arm around her she would think I'm a creep. Also, I've done so many things that made her even less attracted to me. I'm really weird. I joke about the most grotesque things all the time, and she doesn't like it. I am a terrible hugger. I can't hug. She's the one who taught me how to "romantically" hug (I guess). She literally told me "you're terrible at hugging" then showed me where to put my arms (don't ask how I can mess up hugs I'm just that terrible). Also, I'm shorter than her by like an inch, and I'm a few months younger than her. She's a year above me in school. I can't stop thinking about her. It's been like this for the past 2 years (although the teasing stuff only started recently). I hate to admit it, but I was more into her than my girlfriend a year ago. Knowing she'll never see me in a romantic way kills me on the inside. I'm not sure if there's any advice really to be given here, but I needed a place to vent.
Awww :'D 
I actually was the same way. But if she's teasing you, well if you feel like you're being teased, then she must obviosly have some kind of feeling towards you and maybe doesn't want you to know. Well that's how I see it anyways.
Update: She's not into me at all. In fact she's not into anyone. She really wants to stay single for a really long time. Which I can respect, but god damn that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt less. Although, even if she was looking for a relationship I doubt it'd be me anyway.
If it hurts this much, maybe you should tell her. Best case scenario: she feels the same way and its all great. Worst case: She doesnt and any relationship you ever had with her crumbles and trust me, that is extreeemely painful but atleast then you can start to move on, because theres no way of moving on when shes teasing you like this and no matter how long you wait, it wont ever feel like a good time to tell her 
Okay, but I still want to be her friend. Also, last week she said that she'll probably end up kissing me because "theres just those people who you like know its gonna happen". If I told her how much it hurts me we would probably stop hanging out, and I'd never get that kiss XD.
If this is poorly typed it's because I'm sick atm and can't think straight.
I've been through sorta the same thing. I had a friend in high school who I really liked and he would pick on my constantly. My friends and teachers told me he was flirting with me (I suck at recognizing when someone is flirting with me....and I can't hug right either so don't feel bad about that! lol). One day a friend of mine asked him if he liked me and he said only as friends, that I was too much like a sister to him to date. It really broke my heart. To this day I have yet to date anyone. I won't lie to you, it's painful, you get lonely. But sometimes you just have to play it cool and wait it out. If you're afraid that spilling your feelings about her would break your friendship then maybe just give it a little more time. Maybe tease back a little. Sometimes teasing with people turns out to be a good way to gently show your feelings about them :)
OH GREAT. Recently she's been saying I'm like her brother. One of my best friends (who said he wouldn't do anything with her because of how much I like her) recently told her he was into her, so now they're like almost a thing. I can't play it cool around them. I try but she sees that I'm hurt by something even when I'm smiling. I want to tell her everything, but she also told me usually when people express interest in her she stops being interested in them. I want to stay in her life for a long time even if it means not being with her, but I also rather her not be dating one of my best friends. I'm sure no one cares anymore, but I need a place to vent/rant.

She went from not wanting to date to desprately wanting anyone. Her low self-esteem makes her think only people who are high can find her attractive. How do I tell her she's absolutely amazing without coming on too strong? I can't help but to go into paragraphs when I talk about her.
Good, she is offcially dating someone who used to be one of my best friends. I'm happy for her. He'll make her happy.
Fake ;-;
hope you find someone :3
Katie is 24 now. .
Talk with your family doctor (if you have one) because self diagnosing isn't healthy because it gets you paranoid.
If you unfortunately dont have one - go to a family member you trust and I know it's really difficult to speak with someone when your mind is constantly worrying.
Though speaking with anyone that you can calmly sit down with - will definitely help.
The internet is great for many things but it can't give you a solution unless you know it yourself lol
Yeah, I know the internet isn't exactly the best place to look up things about health, but I came across an article and it described exactly how I feel, making me -indeed- paranoid. It's quite impossible to make an appointment with my doctor without my parents knowing; they probably get an email about the fact that there is an appointment set. I also have quite the trust issues thanks to earlier events in my life so I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them on such a level. I do trust my family(parents and sister, we're not that close with the rest of the family) and can talk to them about a lot of things most kids don't get to talk about because the parents are too busy or just never talk very openly, but the last time(one year ago) I was feeling the same and I decided to talk to a trust-person at school, my parents got kinda mad I went to someone at school and that I should just come to them. They ended it with saying that I was just feeling a little down and that I should cheer up, and I did, but it was in the time spring was beginning again, when my mood lifts up again. I don't want to turn to someone at school again and my parents won't take me seriously, so I was hoping someone on the internet could help... I know it's kind of stupid :P
Well, I just talked to them and they reacted like I thought they would: 'It's just puberty.'. So that's just fenominal. My mother did say she was going to look it up and research it, but knowing her, I doubt we'll actually go see a doctor. Thanks for helping me, though. I really appreciate it.

Damn near well rucked up myself. This is among the most inspirational speech I've ever heard. It literally applies to every aspect of life
I really need some advice! I'm about to enter high school and I have no idea how it's like and I'm so afraid of becoming a loner again. :(
you hae got blesed by father doge
im single butt im dogesexual so??
I need help I think I'm going crazy things are going bad for me right now.
First off my mom hates me she thinks im weird  she says there are no emo black girls and that no one with half a brain would date a black emo she says I'll never find love and that I embarrass her
If anybody have any advice I'd  really like to hear it
Do you live with any other parental figure? Or have any secondary parent/gaurdians that can take care of you? Firstly, it isn't right at all for someone to tell their daughter that. So if she has been a burden for a while, I would suggest moving in with someone else that can take care of you. Emphasis on the "someone else" and "take care of you" part. Because you need life essentials and a good caring person, otherwise then they are not doing their job right :p . If all goes wrong and you really need to be out, if you are 100% sure, I would personally call up the foster home or call a phone line for child abusement or such. But if you don't wanna be forced out of home, do not do this.I can't really help much, and I had no experience, just people I dated before had struggles is all.
Hey, and I just have this big question to myself that I couldn't figure out on 2015... Why is it that people suddenly think I'm just a bad guy when I try to explain things to them? Do they think it's because I seem "so smart"? Why? Why do people always try to betray me when they were once my friends...? Nothing good has happened to me on 2015, and I'm afraid that I'm going into a sink-hole THIS year...
I know how you feel. I don't know either
Weird topic to discuss, but honestly, I've never been in a relationship....Mostly because I'm afraid of losing the man I love. I can only imagine what it's like to hold or be held by the person you love the most, but I've never experienced it. I'm still even a kiss virgin. Honestly I don't care if I never find love, but all I want to know is how does it feel like to be in a relationship.
It feels amazing but that means when its over you feel dead inside..
That is another reason why I'm afraid. I want a guy who will stay with me...whom I can hold in my arms till dawn each day.
Hun he's out there looking for you too
Love is when you would die for the person/animal/thing without hesitation. Love is when you know no matter how many miles apart you are that he/she will never stray. Love is like Adrenaline: You love it when its with you and feel like shit when it leave you. Love is YOLO in its emotional form.
You're a teenager. Hormones = love to you people. Very few people end up marrying their high school sweetheart and even fewer of those marriages last. Take that as you will. However, Take this time that you have now to get experience with your emotions and realize that being hurt is a part of the human experience and that we all have to face our fears eventually. I took the same approach you did when I was your age and I'm an emotional retard in the sense that I don't understand emotion all that well. However, since I hit my 20's I started get out there and in a little under two years, i've been in a few serious relationships and can say that in this time, I grew much more as a person that I did in 7 years from the time I was 13 until I turned 20. Make the memories and cherish them. That's something I'll never be able to do because I squandered that opportunity
I'm only seeking opinions right now. I don't care when I find love honestly and I'm not planning on starting something anytime soon. Thanks for the advice so far.
i dont know anymore everytime im im love the other person uses me then shits on me so i dont know
Love can be one sided. know that. you may love them but they may not feel the same. just hope for the best and live every moment like its your last
love is shit.
love is alot of things.
Love is completly different for every person and is impossible to explain. You are going to get hurt. That is inevitable. But addressing those feelings will make you stronger as a person. I don't know how old you are, but I'm assuming you are young. There is no reason to take relationships so serisouly until you are in your 20's and can function in the world as an independent adult. You have all the time in the world.
Petrova, I honestly don't want to play around with relationships. I have been hurt in love ( at least I haven't kissed those guys ) and I'm not willing to do it again. If I have to I'll die alone, it's no big deal for me.
love is the one thing in life, that its worth getting hurt by. as that famous says goes, better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all. i have lost such a deep love and mother of my children, a hole no one will fill to the top. But it was worth the pain to know her and be her love. Its wiorth that pain that no one can know til they feel it. who knows maybe a new girl is around ready to try fill that hole.. That alone is worth trying. love is her, her is love. love is real , real is love. Love is pain, pain is love. love is wanting to be loved. Lyrics from a John Lennon song.
A relationship doesn't just happen. It's like a friendship, but more. You build up feelings for someone. You start noticing them more, start thinking about them more and eventually smile more whenever they talk to you or look at you. It's a long progress, that is, if it is true love. Not just a crush. After a while, you will get annoyed at them more, or feel sad when they don't text you back, but feel happy when they send you a selfie or just a simple text. When you're in a relationship and you'll get text after you wake up like "Good morning beautiful, did you sleep well?" it will make your heart beat faster. You will smile more and love talking to them. It is a feeling that you cannot quite explain, in my opinion. But it feels good. I do suggest you don't just hop on the crush train, but rather wait it out if you like someone, build a friendship and get to know them, then take the first step :)
I'm currently engaged to the one I love.

Honestly true love is when you give everything you have and expect nothing in return.

Me I've risked everything. I've ruined my life by how I tried to be with my love but still that has not stopped me. Since that disaster we've actually became closer than ever. We are now engaged and preparing to try again to live together.


It's been along hard and hurting road to get to where I am today.
I've loved and lossed and was cheated on, rebounded and broke up, went bi and dated a guy, been used and ditched, then found my love.

It's a long tuff road but if you make it through it, the feelings are priceless. :)
Sorry but on a comical side now the song "What Is Love" keeps ringing through my head. XD
Forgive me.
So this is pretty embarrassing but I have no one else to go to but how is it to be loved? I never been in a relationship and i have never been kissed by a boy. I'm not pretty and really quite but I've had boys asked me out and I always say no for some reason. I guess I'm afraid to be hurt by someone I care about. How can I open up to some one?
How do I delete symptoms of boredom 
I'm  really really bored right now. ...
lol
ive been depressed for as ling as i can remember but i acted on it 3 month ago and imve been really deprressed again ecpessially today... i just want to die and i dont want to cut again becasue im 55 days clean today... help?
Take up smoking, or find some hobby that'll keep you occupied for a while. As a bipolar, when I feel an episode coming, that's what I do
i smoke already but my mum found my pack i think...
Have you tried talking to anyone about how you feel?
i feel it, the struggles real.
Don't smoke. Physically it can worsen your feelings. Don't replace a bad habit with another bad one. When you are feeling sad/suicidal talk to a friend, write down your feelings, play some music, take a walk. Set aside something specific to do when you are feeling like cutting.
I know how you feel. I had been cutting for about four years. I did stop three times for about 5 months max. Today, I haven't cut for about two months. It's rough, because you're used to rely on something to get you through. But in the end, it only worsens the situation. You should keep it up and mark each month you've been clean. Be proud of yourself, be positive. It will help you get through the withdrawals. Because cutting doesn't help for the long run. Sometimes you just have to take a deep breath, raise a fist in the air and tell yourself you're better than that. You can do it.
Listen I have been depressed for a long time and I used to self harm but I don't anymore because when I used to it just made it worse but having people around you that care about you helps out a lot.
No girl likes me, I guess I really am just a loser. I never made good grades in school, my grades were always shit. I am dropping out before the beginning of next year. I am tired of everything. I am getting a GED. That won't get me nowhere. What point do I have on this planet? I hate being so lonely. Nobody in general likes me. My mother prefers my other two little brothers over my worthless, stupid ass. She always calls me a liar when I try to call her out to my grandmother and so does she. She calls me a retard, she says she hates me, wishes she never had me, she told me "fuck you", she calls me a special ed kid and a dumbass and all kinds of other shit. I am tired of this shit. Nobody fucking cares about me. They would rather see me rot on the streets. I'll be homeless before long. I'm not gonna ask people for money, because I know that nobody would give me anything, because nobody gives a flying fuck about me. If I were to die, people would probably just walk right over me, or if they cared enough, they would push me to the side so other people could walk through. I'm a pussy. I can't fight back or defend myself when people bully me. When people talk shit to me, I just try to prevent a fight. If I was a real man, I would fight them. I don't fight, I just get beat up time and time again. I've had my nose broken, my eyes swelled shut, been jumped, had my phone and other stuff stolen, but despite all of that, never did anything about it. I've tried dating girls before, but they always turned me down or cheated on me. And in those relationships, they were actually long distanced and never from a girl at school. I'm always nervous around girls. I'd rather die than talk to a girl, because I've got literally nothing that any girl wants. I'm a psycho, I'm a loner, I'm ugly, I exhibit bad health. Survival of the fittest, they say. I guess I truly am the undeserving and unworthy, because I can't survive out in the real world. I just can't.
I want to die now. The problem is, I can't get my hands on a gun to shoot myself, because my grandfather hides all of his guns away from me inside a large metal rectangular-shaped winchester gun safe, and I can't unlock it. I am pissed off. I might just threaten his life for him to give me his guns. Either that or just kill my whole damned family before taking an angle grinder to the fucking case. FUCK IM TIRED OF ALL THIS GODDAMN SHIT, I FEEL LIKE SCREAMING!

And I'm also a jobless recluse, who doesn't even have a permit at 7-fucking-teen. My family is too lazy to do anything for me. And that's why I'm so lazy. T.T
Girls don't matter. If one girl doesn't like you or a few girls don't like you, that just means they aren't the ones who are gonna love you forever. Life gets better, I swear. Everything that happens today, you can make better tomorrow. Surround yourself with people who make you happy and you make them happy. Negativity breeds more negativity, but the good thing is positivity does the same. Here's a quote that had a big impact on me "I have found if you love life, life will love you back" I hope you have a wonderful day and a wonderful life.
it seems every time i go into a relationship im either cheated on or told nobody could ever love someone like me it makes me wonder if there is something wrong with me.
No there is nothing wrong with you my first bf cheating on me with basically every girl he knew there is nothing wrong with you its just a messed up world
Oh and kaikeeler ddon't worry there's nothing wrong with u, there's something wrong with them, u will find someone who won't hurt but help u and care about u
Proud of u. It is good emo porn
Sorry but why are you watching porn? You're a child.

REKTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Triggered much? I'm genuinely concerned as to why you'd watch porn, as your profile says you were born in 2003. Like damn. Would you get offended if someone told you not to cross the street when there's cars passing? I'm pathetic, but you're the one wasting your time on porno at 13?

I'm not trying to offend you, you're just getting unnecessarily offended, my guy.
This is basically the definition of "I'm different than others my age!!! I'm so mature!!!"
Get a joke? I don't watch porn. I was just pointing out how you repeatedly comment on anything I post like you have nothing to do. I'm not triggered, just annoyed. And no, I am not claiming I'm different from anyone my age or more mature than them. Thank you.
If the reason I comment is that I have nothing to do, then the reason you make these posts in the first place is that you have nothing to do.
Amputee porn... Seems legit :llll
Eye Color Spells

5 seconds in and some 48 gender fag is 1) still alive and 2) already blocking. You're 13 and have no idea what the fuck life is. you're just mad that your fire crotch cunt can't get anything but another fat taco to bump with you. I may say this a lot but this is very genuine when I tell your "male" faggot ass to kill yourself...please do it now. and at least you can creamate yourself because that fire on your head and pussy is burning you already. so...kill yourself. 14 years in and already not worth it JFC.
Who is it?
You, fucking cuck. Carrot top bitch. You literally are using an old photo. I understand you are stupid (because you think there are more than 2 genders) but I'm not you, and not stupid. You are so pathetic. Honestly, leave and never comeback. The DB shows you deleted your acc and made a new one 5 min later. so stfu you 14 year old twat.
Think ya have the wrong person m8. There are more than more than two genders. Girl, boy, both, neither. Easy.
Listen boy/girl I don't know who you are talking about and why you are so triggered by the fact that there are more than two genders but keep me out of it. I just found this website today and I would rather not get spammed with something I'm not even apart of. Byebye.
top ramen looking ass. there are only two genders, the rest is either mental disorder or wanting to look unique or both. you need some dr. paul r .mchugh in your life grow the fuck up and read some facts.
WHEN SHE TRIES SO FUCKIN HARD TO NOT BE HERSELF BUT WILL NOT ADMIT THERE IS ONLY 2 GENDERS. LMFAO THIS BITCH NEEDS TO KILL HERSELF. WHAT A WASTE OF LIFE LMFAO.
I'm just gonna go I have no clue what is happening, you have your own mental problems that you need to solve.
says the one who has gender identity disorder.
^ TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Title says it all. Discuss?
He was just hungry for power.
So what you're saying, is he wasn't a bad guy, just hungry for power?
It's justa point of view, really.For some he was bad and for others good

Seems like a great guy to me.
Hitler is daddy 
well if you want a real answer you must first take a long hard look at how ww1 ended and start there, after ww1 germany had to endure one of the most terrifying and humiliating times in world history they had nothing the reichmark was worth nothing due to france demanding ridiculous sums of money for war reparations and when germany couldnt deliver the massive sums france helped themselves so to speak and took the coalmines in the ruhr, berlin was the cesspit of the world in the 1920s anyone and anything could be bought, sexclubs with children as young as 10-11 was all over berlin and perverts from all around the world stormed to berlin to capitalize on germanys hard times, and its in this era when germany is so morally bankrupt that hell itself would blush that the NSDAP takes form and gains strength from families who had to sell their daughters not even in their teens to old perverted men from all over the world just to get by each day and its these very ppl who wanted change more than anything else and that is when adolf hitler came into the picture (and as they say desperate times calls for desperate measures) so there where streetfights every day in berlin amongst other citys the farleft (the spartacists) and the far right (freikorps consisting of soldiers and veterans of ww1 still itching to fight for germany) fullscale civil war was a fact and part of daily life in germany inthe 20s and by night berlin was riddled with sin of the most diabolical kind and its in this cesspool of pervertedness and horrifying shit that hitler started to gain support by the thousands every day, so when the election of 1933 rolled around hitler won and promised to change things and he did he even chose to put up a NSDAP headquarter in a former pedophile sex club in berlin jsut to make a statement that things where going to change, and they did adolf hitler got rid of the massive unemployment problem and gave the people statefunded vacations (something that no other nation did during this time) and built several wonders such as the autobahn germany soon was no depraved state but a flourishing superpower and all this he achieved in 4 years so i have seen many old people from germany who to their death supported adolf hitler and said to those who asked how they possibly can think hitler was a great leader to this day that "you where not there you cant possibly understand the hell we lived in before hitler saved us" and since im a socially awkward emotionally detached individual i can see the germans from that times reasoning and i understand it even, its true we today cant possibly understand the horror that was germany after ww1 and to them hitler was a hero a saviour who saved both germany and the german people, im not promoting hitelr here dont get me wrong im jsut saying that there is two sides to every coin and furthermore this is the short version the story of hitelr and his rise and support is a long and complex one
TL; DR. ^
if it is then why ask such a complex question? i just tried to answer an enourmous question and that will be long.
Didn't ask it, not my post.
ok but why even remark that its to long when you know that question is extremely complex? and demands a long and thorough answer?
Used his power for evil. Yes, he was a bad guy.
It didn't REALLY require an input, it's a sarcastic questioin, because he didn't do anything wrong. I don't need a lengthy answer because I know my thoughts. As for witchcraft wife, you're most likely a jew

Still a rat though. An idiotic piece of shit tbh.
Hitler = Keemstar on a political scale.
so im gonna put up a thesis here that INSANITY is it formed over time or something you are born with?
so i have been thinking a long time that for example when shit happens alot it takes a toll on the psychee for example sweden where i live our politicians are so so so disconnected from reality that the entire left is infiltrated by islamists, militant islamists and when i was a little kid i witnessed on the news the killing of a politician named anna lind she was killed by an insane man who just went to one of her meetings in a mall and just stabbed her and he was declared insane, was this man insane by birth or driven to it by the madness that is todays society? and are the politicians realy that naive to think that when they make decisions over the ppls heads the ppl will just shrug their shoulders and pretend like nothing has happened? like its not a big deal to bypass the fundamentals of democracy, i for one think that insanity is osmething one can be driven towards out of necessity formed out of the current situation so in other words some forms of "insanity" is just a case of "desperate times calls for desperate measures" like just think about how many people right now as im writing this sits at home just boiling of hate towards the sitting government and just think how many of those millions of people actually are capable of doing something about it it doesnt take much, all you need is a kitchen knife and to have reached boiling point, do these "democrats" realy think they will get away with it just because they make the decisions, history has shown us that you cant rule a country without the people on your side, so again insanity is it born or formed over time
It depends. It can be about how one was raised. Osama Bin Laden was raised by a Muslim extremist, so he became a Muslim extremist. But I don't think Hitler was raised by fascists (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not very knowledgable on wwi/wwii history)
I just want a daddy to cut with and fuck whenever I'm bored rawr xD lolz I'm so random ofc you'll have to be okay with me cheating on you LOLZ
You're just a big NINNY

Do I even want to try to comprehend what is happening here?
What's the big deal here? There's people a lot more fucked up than her
I'm sorry but people who self-diagnose mental illnesses are kinda making things a little harder for those of us who were profesionally diagnosed. I'm in a few discussion groups for people with mental issues and we're targets for harassment from idiots who accuse us of making up our problems for attention.

It's also pretty annoying to see people on tumblr self-diagnosing themselves with long lists of mental illnesses. I'm pretty sure it's not possible for people to have both autism AND aspergers...
UHM EXCUSE YOU I HAVE DEPRESSION ANXIETY PTSD BIPOLAR DISORDER DIMENTIA AUTISM ADHD SCHIZOPHRENIA OCD I HAVE EVERYTHING I TOOK A TEST ONLINE I. AM. MESSED UP. XD i totally agree with you. if you self diagnose then go to a doctor and make sure so you can help ^-^ but girls nowadays think its cute to be extremely fucked up.
The worst is when kids on tumblr think you can get PTSD from online harassment
yep agree on that i was diagnosed with adhd, ocd, ptsd, bipolar disorder and aspergers when i was 14 and have since went to 9 different psychiatrists and behavioural therapists and i get a bit ticked of when i see people whine about getting ptsd from online bullying and say that online harassment is the same as physical and psychological bullying irl because their version of bullying is countered by doing as follows...TURN OF THE PC! when irl bullying is well its irl so you cant get away unless you change school/workplace so by propagating for "stop internet harassment" on the same level (often higher level and intensity) than irl harassment and bullying it makes me so fucking mad, i suffered through 9 years straight in 3 different schools of irl hardcore bullying so when i see these little shits whining about that they got ptsd from online harassment from stuff like mean fb comments i flip my shit basically its just so fucking dumb...
I agree. I see a lot of people saying they have severe anxiety all the time. Kinda pisses me off. They think just getting nervous a few times is anxiety. Then people don't believe the people who truly do have anxiety issues. When I took my CNA course my instructor almost took me to a hospital when I had an anxiety attack before big tests. She made me s e a doc and get meds  xD I totally agree with you on that one.
^I used to have severe anxiety about thunderstorms. On sundays my dad used to take me to the park and if there was even one cloud in the sky I refused to go and if I did go, I couldn't enjoy myself because I was just nervous about the weather. Once at a school picnic it was sunny but I still got so anxious that my teacher had to drive me back to the school so my mom could pick me up. Yeah...I'd never go back to that part of my life. Anxiety is definitely NOT cool/cute to have.
Find some other way to look interesting and cool, then.
^I don't make up my problems dude, I was professionally diagnosed with tourettes, ADHD, and anxiety
i see cassettes is as cancerous as ever
Actually, I'm referring to self diagnosis. It makes you look cool. If you oppose it so much, find an alternative.
Ever wondered what whale cum looks like?
^probably the same as humans'.
Derail warning
I'm bipolar, and I also have adhd and ocd. Three illnesses that kids are so quick to claim on tumblr. I never understood the aesthetic of being "fucked up" like, it kind of sucks????? It took me years to get officially diagnosed, it's far more complicated than googling your symptoms.
mmhm true shit and now people use it as a kind of badge of honor because it "sounds cool" i mean for us who suffer from these illnesses and have gone to the countless meetings done the many times realy weird tests and talked to several psychiatrists and gotten the paper to prove it finally its not something we chose to be just because, its something that just happened. nowadays people see it as an accesory and that is fucked up like they think they can just choose wich mental disorders to have.
^True. On another note, there's not really an age for having mental illness. I was 7 when I was diagnosed with tourettes and ADHD.
I feel man. I was ACTUALLY DOCTOR-diagnosed with PTSD, so it really pisses me off when people start wanting disorders and stuff.. It really urks me.
ask it a qwestion DO IT

Okay so currently my sister is in the hospital because tonight she tried to take her life away by a bullet to her head. All because she was unloved and tricked. :'( Isabel was/is a very caring,hard working,sensitive person and she always helps people but never herself and she never disscusses her depression issues with anyone. Seeing my sister like that hurt so much to what no words can describe how I felt seeing her like that. But allow this to be a lesson to those responsible in this, suicide isnt a game and neither is my sister's life. Please dont try to lose your life just because of someone else.
Id honestly love to meet her one day
She should be back in two weeks as long as she starts to heal
Last night because this guy TheEndxXxX broke up with her and she told him if he ever did break up with her she'd kill herself because she loved him and she was accused of just being an attention seeker so she decided to prove she wasnt kidding
How do you know I'm not her friend? Just because a website says so, I still think you're full of it, Isabel. Suicide isn't funny. and No, You obviously don;t know how hospitals work. You should learn about how they work before you pretend to be in one. When you are admitted into a hospital you are under State care, You are under hospital care, Your parents sign you over to the hospital, Your parents sit in admission for hours, and sign paper after paper for a doctor to give you any medication, restrain you, And they are not responsible for you getting into fights, or you dying, or killing yourself or killing anybody else. But, BY LAW. You have rights in the hospital. But a phone call is a privilege . You get one phone call a day, maybe two. But the hospital can take that away from you. and you can only call family. or care takers. Try again, Isabel.
But isabel, I'm done now. No worries. Dont get nervous because im calling you out on your bullshit ,
No youre not my friend because if you were youd believe me but im better than to sit here and get upset over you being a bitch to me I dont care if you believe me only my true friends do and thats all that matters.
Um... A shot to the head is very difficult to survive. If she did shoot herself, she wouldn't be back in two weeks.
Suicide is horribly sad yet perfectly beautiful.
So much hate on here... We should all just chill and be friends.
More childish arguing...
My heart goes out to those affected by this tragedy.
i was in for the same thing last year i was in a mentle hospital for 6 days
I'm too dumb to even commit suicide :P

Anyone want to get fancy into religion? Feel free to discuss.I personally am a Christian.
Taoist
Christian
Catholic and partly Buddhist
Not a religon, obviously, but Atheism for me. It's an interesting mix on Emowire. :3
Christian here
Don't worry Kass, I still love you even though you are forced to be that. It means nothing to me :3 Oh, and as for myself I am Christian Atheist. I believe in the Christian was but I don't really believe in the Bible
Ways*
I wouldn't say I'm an Atheist, but I just don't believe in many things. Only in spirits, but I don't quite believe in religions.
Well I wasn't raised into Christianity, it's really hard to explain. I just have faith and believe. And usually for praying for the best for somebody, and being strong and having faith, the situation calms down. And I thank god verily. And yes, I have apologized for my sins. I have apologized a lot. I know I kinda sound weird but in all do honesty, by all means, I won't judge anyone for their religion :3 .
Athiest, i tolerate others religious beleifs, i dont mind what people beleive because its none of my buisness.
Catholic and Buddhist :3
I mean when it comes to Christianity, I dont really agree with some things that they teach or claim right.
Im more into Buddhism, basicaly because that there are so much more freedom and also their view to world.
Buddhist~
im suprised by the amount of christians here, its impressive of how many people are religiously diverse. it seems impressive and proves that emo is capable of so much
Religion on here is indeed diverse :D .
its a very hpapy thing to see, i hope poltics and opinions become more diverse and more nonconforming, it is a pleasure.
I don't really feel like I belong with any religious sect or group. It's pretty cool though, the human need to believe in something. I respect all religions as they're all quite interesting but I personally find it pointless. I take a particular liking to Nihilism but I am still nothing. just part of a collective species.
I'm Jewish (don't hate me :
I'm an ancient astronaut therosist :)
Athiest
A total atheist.
If you're a christian, don't feel insulted or anything but I've grown a dislike for the religion.
I still try to respect...But it's just hard at times.
^Same here. I know it's not all Christians, but I see Christianity as a hateful religion :/

To be honest  I am kind of in the middle of a lot of religions I like to learn all new ones I was baptized but I still want to learn new things.

Atheist here, but I respect what other people believe in
I was a JW until I was like 12, always hated it
I was raised in a christian home. It just wasn't for me. So i was in secret of Wicca for three years, but i turned agnostic.

I'm follower of mind.I Believe in whatever I see fit.Once my beliefs were close to christianity, once they were like Sci-Fi stories, Once close to atheism, once ...And still going on !
I'm a pagan, but its amazing sseeing the acceptance and diversity on this site!
So myself and a few friends are seriously thinking about converting from Christianity to Jediism and become followers of the Church of Jedi. We all have very little free time but have decided that if one of us goes through with it that we all will and will make time for our pillars of training and become official, certified Jedi. And no this isn't a joke, I'm being 100% dead serious
How much have you researched about it ?And what's the reason for that ?The most Important question :Which belief is more rational ? Which one does your mind accept ??
Hey stone!,
Just thinking, why not just live by your own rules, I bet you already do do that, but why do we need to formally claim a religeon?
I Know you didn't ask me but I just wanted to post my own answer ...
TheDude said:
Why not just live by your own rules ?
TheDude said:
Tch tch tch. You do notneed any rules to follow for yourself. Not talking about community rules which affect others.
Nope. Punishment ain't justice. Justice should be improving society.  My actions do not affect others. Give me a valid example.
TheDude said:
Give me a valid example.
Influencing people? Don't wanna say it loud, but this point you make is stupid. That is the point. It is exploration of thoughts. To observe and think is human, to follow? Well even mules do that.

Nahh... You should paid because you need that money. Ideally your gaurd should pay because he failed his duty. I have worked with the army to build barricades against naxals. I don't want to punish, just helpnthose in need. Rapeists you say? My friend wasbraped. Want the convict to understand that what he did caused us pain and make him understand the right way
 No hate. If that needs brute force, or he just doesn't get the point? So be it
You're the first person I met who is so stuck... So stuck up.. So rigid. Don't know if it's good or bad. The world has no absolutes boy. If you believe in one
 You shall be disappointed.

Non-Religious o.o
I just believe that even if you aren't religious and don't believe in a God, that you should at least agree that the Bible's statements are great morales to live by. In other words the Bible really says most of the time that you should be grateful to be alive every day, you should treat others as they have treated you, and most of all you shouldn't live your life as an asshole because then after you die you will have to go on eternally knowing that no one remembers you fondly.
Only a few of the bible's statements are good morals to live by. The ones about women having to be subservient, and homosexuality being an abomination are utter bullshit.
I'm sort of a Gnostic Luciferian as well as a Unitarian Universalist. My great grandmother and my grandfather were/are Catholic, my mother is a Neo-Pagan, and my father is an atheist. To a degree I respected all of it but could never fully identify with an organized religion.
Wiccan, but I prefer the term neo pagan since I don't practice like a traditional wiccan.

In reference to What Anodyne said Heres a PDF of the Satanic Bible Underground Edition by Lavey himself,
http://rodgerdean.org/meshuggah/The%20Satanic%20Bible%20(Underground%20Edition%202).pdf
Grew up a Christian my entire life... now that I realize I'm not, I'm in agony over the pointlessness of life.
If you have a religion, hang on to it.
All lives are pointless at first. You must give your own life purpose.
You just had the best dream ever (you dream every night) you lived the best week of your life! It was so great! Then you wake up and brush your teeth. You dont remember a thing. Nothing remains. Because no matter how a life goes it is only a dream.

It really isn't healthy for the mind to have that kind of pessimistic mentality
Your probally right! But it doesent matter. You die, nothing else. So my state of mind is of no consequence, is it?
I'm not religious, but who says there's nothing after death? Nobody alive knows, you only find out when you die.
Why would there be? Do you have proof of anything, anything at all spiritual?
Your speculation, like the rest of everyone, is only formed by your wistfullness.
(Yo this is a debate, pls lets not get angry at eachother btw just in case u r :])
You don't have proof of there being nothing after death, I don't have proof of there being something. It's not debatable.
Hey.
Or mabey...
WE WON'T
Because there is nothing to know.
Are you denying that as a possibility?
(Sorry for shouting im chill just some low-key empathise)
With what we can know, the Brain releases massive amounts of DMT upon death, So you are in a dream that makes 10 minutes seem like 10, 20, or even 50 years. 

there are stories of people who even life entire lifes only to realize that they are in a dream an then wake up afterward.

So we clearly do experience SOMETHING that happens when We die. because when we die we will probably have a DMT trip, It depends really, There are some deaths that may completly smash the brain so you cant see such things, 

So you may see a DMT trip upon death, Or you may see nothing at all. And if you do experience a DMT trip, imagine how long it could be within the first several days of dying.
Thats pretty cool, I like that a lot, it still ends though.
Tell me why and how if you would.
I'll be spooning the person to death
I hope you mean with litteral spoons!
nope I meant by spooning with the person :3
No I wouldn't
you guys got issues xD
I've never understood hatred, it's a stupid emotion that's make you hurt yourself because you are mad at someone else ahaha xD. You should try to let go theses dark feelings of yours and think about more joyful things.
theses are similar feelings that end to the same result. I prefer focusing on my work, my hobbies and my interests. Than thinking about people I dislike, it make a whole lot of difference in life :3
I do honestly focus on hobbies most of the time. Only once in a blue moon like today do I think about these things.
well I never think about people I hate, I don't give them any place in my life. and when I would be about to think about them... well I wank a good time and that's all ahaha xD
I guess we all have different pass times haha
yeahh I guess we may have... be warned I could try to tempt you to the dark side x3
Honey, I AM the dark side xD
ohhhh.... have you ever danced with the devil under the pale moon light?
Well... let me think about the ways how I would do this. Suicide bombing, MK-19 grenade launcher maybe nuclear holocaust... so many ways to do something so fun :D
Yes. It's my line of work
Done it before, why not again.....
And if so, knives are my favorite, cutting the beautiful butterflies into the skin.....oh how wonderful they shall look when i am done carving them into a masterpiece!!
Torture is fun as well, skinning and wearing it as a coat is another option.
I'd only kill bad people like murders, rapists pedophiles, abusers, corrupt people ect. I'd kill people how the Assassins on Assassins Creed with a Hidden blade like what the Assassins wear to hide their hidden blades on that game.
It would be Justice for me because some people get away with horrible things and deserve to die. I'd do it by assassination.
Depends on the person, really.
Yes. I would kill someone. Because she screwed with my life so much. She even tried to kill me. How I would kill her you ask, First I'd use a sedative and drag her into the woods in the middle of no where. I'd wear gloves and have my body covered in plastic, including my shoes. When she woke up I'd have a sinister grin and tell her WHY I'm doing this to her. I'd take out a needle and sew her eyelids under her eyebros and to her cheek so she has to watch everything I do. Next, I'd shove knives in the edges of her skin, pinning her to something. Then I'd slowly made a few cuts along her neck, then take away the thing she loves the most, her hair. I'd burn it in front of her. Then, I's start to rip out her organs, keeping her alive before I dump kerosine oil on them and light them on fire as I watch her burn. When her body is fully burned, I'll toss my clothes into the flames and grind up her bones so that there is no evidence. (PLEASE DO NOT BE WORRIED THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS. THE GIRL MOVED TO AUSTRALIA)
How utterly beautiful, i am happy that there are others with such wonderful imaginations such as my own.

If you want I can tell you who it is
I am open to know anything you wish me to.
I like that idea. Some of us have already grasped insanity and are merely waiting to finally snap.
Well I feel killing or wanting to kill is pointless. Live is too short for hatred... I have way more interesting way to spend my time
Many such as myself do not wish to bear hatred, some of us are born with it.....molded into beasts that lust for blood. It is choice for many of you, but for some there is no way to rid of this bloodlust.
I think hatred is stupid... it's basically an emotion that consist about hurting yourself because you hate someone else.
I have an advice for you, find an activity that help you to evacuate both your stress and frustations, Use it to release your anger. I swear it's gonna make you a new person

I do not think it's simple, I just think if you put the effort in it you can truly makes your life better. You are the sculptor of your own life
Perhaps, but one's life is also dependant on interactions with other people, and that in turn effects the outcome of one's mental landscape. Are you insinuating that i have not tried? That i dont care for anything? That i am another useless being hellbent on destruction for no reason? Perhaps you are correct in some cases, but i assure you i have tried, i spent much of my younger years in a mental hospital: trying. Is it not acceptable to be what i am? I tried many things, and yet nothing works, do you know why? It is because the thing you wish for me to change, is not meant to be changed. Who and what i am, they are not meant to be tampered with, as it has been altered through my past experience. So you cannot say that i havent tried. Who are you to know what i have and haven't done? Even still, i hate discussing myself, it makes me feel as though you look at this problem as a small matter. There are many who suffer just as i do, and my thought is: if i can survive it, so can they. We do not need to change who we are to suit your social agenda, we only need to fight these monsters within, and find acceptance in our own sorrows.
I agree with you Dylan, but I can never forget watching her scream in her sleep, struggling all around screaming to stop that he's hurting her, all the nightmares she suffered with over them because of everything they did to her. All the scars on her body she tried to hide from me because she couldn't forget what they did. Even as I type this I can't stop shaking. I have nightmares about it all, about watching her and not be able to help her or do anything... Her screams echo through my mind over and over because of them... Because of him, because of those few people she actually trusted who used it against her. I can never forget or give those guys...
I know what you mean, and it must be something horrible to bear with it, and I'm not talking about forgiving something horrible that has been done. I'm more talking about focusing your energy somewhere else on building something new and better
Dude... this discussion is fuckin' creepy man. O.o In the army, we did have to work on a mine-field in a major Naxal area. They'd keep attacking the villagers. So we had to lay down a mine-field. "practice for you" said the commander. Hated it man. Just the thought of killing someone is too scary for me. And the forest thing... and assassin thing man... you people need to calm the fuck down. Or watch a movie or smoke or fap. Anything would do, but kill the negativity man... it burns yee.
yeahhh xD finally someone with sense.... everyone feel anger, we just need to find a constructive way to expulse it from us, and if there's nothing constructive to work on.... wanking works wonder indeed
Totally dude. Like when totally pissed go do push ups or something. Or run!!!! Running's awsome too dude!
@BeautyWithinTheLifeless...
Do you believe in hypnosis? I do, very much indeed! It does help clear inner negativity. Try the s.t.e.m.s. process to reveal all your emotional stress. I'll forward it to you. it is a set of questions you need to ask yourself repeatedly untill you have an emotionla out break. Once that is done, go for this hypnosis for clearing sub-concious negativity vid on yourtube. It has a candle in its picture. Be sure to try it out.
Still you have yet to understand, but i shall not pester you any longer with my own problems. Yes, i have tried hypnosis therapy along with many other things, but as i said before, none of it works. It isnt emotional stress, it is the hatred i feel for myself as a form of barrier against.....things within me i dont think you would understand. They say it is wrong to be you, and yet they tell you that you are a monster when you take their advice. The only thing left for myself and others is resorting to masks, to false identities within the human mind. Society will never accept us for we are a sign of reality.
How old are you my friend?
Yes you should accept you as you are. You are perfect!!! No issues. The problem is when you do not. Love what you are.
To love being a bloodthirsty beast is unwise. If i accept him....then the death of myself and many others would be imminent.
I am whatever age you might believe me to be. Some say i am in my 30's, others say i am in my teens.
-_-
Gaze upon me with your eyes of disaproval, i dont mind, it is not as if i havent already faced judgment already. Act as though i am lying, i care not, the truth can purify oneself and condemn oneself to a hell in which i inhabit. So go ahead and judge me like all the rest. Your gaze will never reach me, and your words will die in my heart.
I do not like what i am, but i cannot change it either. Acceptance seems to be the obvious course of action. And yet with that, a door to a far darker place would open. Perhaps it is right for me to cross that line. Perhaps not. I do not try to stay stuck inside of my own problems, instead i try to stride forward. At times one must look back to see what has become of them, to question the path taken and further evaluate the situation. Perhaps i have gone too far. Perhaps not. Either way, i shall fade with the tide, and rise once again with the moon at my back.
You're so poetic... I'm just saying, you don't have to accept what you don't like. You can keep pushing yourself through anything that gets in your way and become what you truly want to be... The same goes for most things. I want to change the world because I can't stand it as it is today and I will change it for the better. There is a lot of work to be done on my part if I am to do this though... and there I go I was nearly onto another topic so I'm done now.
Bro you need to chill. xD
If you killed someone and you aren't the law or in the army why aren't you in prison?
I served my time in a mental hospital, because i was so young they felt it would be brutal to place me in juvenile detention. After i was released, i was assigned to a therapist, and a long story after that.
Well this was worth the read :)
Maybe yes, maybe no ;-;
yes i would kill someone if they commit certain acts wich is primarily rape and pedophilia
if a person commits one or both of these acts i see it as if they have forfeited their humanity i see them as mere animals and should be treated as a common snail pestering your garden.
True that^
well that puts things into a nice intelligently put perspective anodyne u realy have the talent of writing :) and while i do agree with ur post i must add that maaaany people such as myself has certain diagnoses that stops the brain from using moral in a subject such as if someone has done a thing such as rape or another horrible act of violence upon someone i care deeply about my brain turns of n i could without problems kill someone by curbstomping them, (im not psycho i have aspergers wich basically means i have extremely hard to feel empathy but it also means that i give unbiased response to things) for example i am a promoter of the deathpenalty when it comes to terror crimes and pedophilia some people (well most) thinks that i am a monster for saying that a man who rapes a child should get a bullet to the head, u see in my logical little world he the rapist should not get payed prisonstay on taxpayers money it costs waaay to much and they cant be rehabilitated therefore they will do it again and again so my logical non emotional brain says that the only solution is death a bullet costs about 2 dollars, its like when i signed up for the military here in sweden they shut me out because of "psychological instability" due to me having aspergers, adhd, bipolar disorder and extreme lack of empathy they basically made me sound like a total psycho in their "excuse" to not letting me serve in afghanistan for a 2 year stretch. i just wanted to protect people from isis n such but because of peoples view on my diagnoses im considered psychologically unfit for service, so in conclussion it depends on the guy or woman holding the gun, bat, pipe, or any other form of weapon and that guy who just bashed another guys brain in might have had a extremely good reason for it but since our society of today is totally based on moral standards the real psychos gets free empathy passes wich is total fucking idiocy
In all technicalities, that puts you in the minority position in this discussion. If you already have something inhibiting your ability to feel empathy, you can't answer question that's rooted in morality without a large bias. Our empathy and knowledge of society is what allows us to make important split second moral decisions. I don't disagree that there are plenty of extreme situations that could call for the death penalty. I think that population control is quite an important thing in all honesty. Our world is full of violent people, and although there is hope at rehabilitation (something that's shown really well in European prisons) I don't feel that everyone deserves that second chance. Hell, even if we don't have the death penalty in effect, the least we could do is chemical castration so that we can prevent people like that from moving the human race forward (or backward?). I don't agree with eugenics when it comes to "racial purity" and shit like that, but if we're talking about hard criminals and the legitimate mentally insane? I think it's absolutely something to consider.
I completely understand why the military wouldn't enlist you due to the mental diagnosis. Even if you as an individual are in control, there's too many chances of someone with the same slurry of disorders to make the wrong decision in a crisis situation due to the inhibition of empathy. Laws are problematic, because ideally we'd be able to take everything as a case by case basis, analysing every angle of the situation presented, but we can't. It would encroach on human rights, personal freedoms, and privacy. Due to this, they have to make umbrella laws that dictate what can and cannot be allowed. It could be very likely that someone with severe bipolar disorder and aspergers might act out violently when the situation doesn't call for it, and that's exactly why you weren't allowed in. With our current knowledge of the disorders and disabilities, it poses a lot of risks to give a gun to someone who is potentially unstable.I pass no judgment on people with mental disabilities so long as they can control themselves, so don't take my message as a direct attack on your character or something of the like, this is just a rant from my perspective.
i once again am baffeled by your ability to express yourself in words :) and no im not taking any offence i know that im not the best to ask about morally complicated choices since i put the good next to the bad for example if someone commits a horrible crime that does not kill such as rape or severe violence this in turn could lead to the victim in question to commit suicide or at the very least be mentally and psychologically damaged for all time wich in some ways is worse than death so if this guy who commits this crime gets a 3-6 years sentence for brutal violence or any other violence related crime and that is then considered "served his time" and "payed his debt to society" i strongly believe that the person responsible for inflicting such psychological and physical harm that will plague and haunt this victim for his or hers entire life should be put to death and not a prison sentence, i live in sweden our prisonsentences are jokes it has become such a moral controlled situation here that now there is no longer a question of "why did the rapist do it" now its the disgusting question towards the victim "did you make sufficient resistance and hold your legs closed" and that is the result of a society gone totally batshit crazy overboard with a empathy controlled legal system, and the empathy has come to such a disgusting degree that the most violent and disgusting of fellons gets separate wards where the rest of the inmates cant get to them just because of empathy that somehow we are supposed to feel for a guy who has raped a 11 year old girl to death (that actually happened here) and the papers wrote about it as if he was the victim, that is how much the empathy controls this country, sweden is a enourmous crisscross of different empathy guided rules and exceptions such as psychological,drug related,ethnicity,if the rape victim made totaly clear to not wanting to get raped etc etc the list goes on its a giant joke our legalsystem is upside down and no country should want to mimic our model of empathy driven madhouse system
I would, for any personal gain whatsoever. But i dont want to get into trouble and im super lazy to not do the planning involved in it.
Mabey i would feel bad afterwords...Mabey I'm unknowingly saying BS and i wouldent do it...
But ive done stupeder things for no reasons before, and never do I learn my lesson that it was not worth it.

Those who pose a signifigant threat to my safety will be dealt with.
And i absolutly agree with what Anodyne said. We are improving as a society, when thing get serious we are considerate and kind. when it comes to enetertainment, we know better, but we find amusement out of knowing its fictional, Anyways yeah, when shit like this really happens we react better than back then.
Do you Feel mankind will ever make it to space? what will it be like? what will the politics be like in space. Do you feel nations of today could one day be a spacefaring empire?

Someone once said that humanity will be safe from cataclysm once we expand upon the stars...
That, and It's the most humane solution to overpopulation.
Agreed.
That moment when you feel all alone.. And question what Ur worth is just to find out you're worthless! I don't actually have the balls to pull the trigger but I wish everyday that my heart would just stop beatin.
Personally, I dont think anyone, no matter who, can be worthless. How could you find your worth?

Hey guys! My name is Karla...I'm very lonely and would love to find someone to be the cookie to my cookie monster. I am a hopeless romantic and I want to find my forever (stupid I know). I have found my true love but I lost him...so yeah. I'm just a broken soul....
I wonder how many members live in carolina though...
[Thought you might appreciate a reply regardless of the content...Its probally awkward for people to reply; but it is probably more for you if no one does.]
I know it's stupid but I thought what the hell I'll give it a shot I mean you never know I'm not looking exactly right now for a girlfriend but if you are interested then maybe we could start talking and see where it leads I'm okay with an online long distance relationship I've had a couple before. Also It'd be nice if you were into anime to Lolx
You and like 80% of the people on here. You'll probably be with one of these kids by the end of the week xD
Heyyy I am looking as well and tbh I am sooo into Anime. It is litterally all I watch. I am open to talk to anyone at any point..soo hmu I guess lol
Just why
Sans said: Just why
Emowire's new motto.
Jeez isn't this new xD
Hi just a single emo.
Lonely emo I'm really looking for a gf in USA pa I need connections with girls who are near me but are that emo.
hi
i just wanted to say a few things regarding subcultures, if you since an early age have been through shit (psychological,physical etc etc) and your young brittle mind gets put through shit that most adults never have to witness is it then strange that a person become somewhat different... you then can become introverted and have a negative outlook on life before it has even begun, and this is where shit gets interesting and where people starts the labeling...if a person have endured abuse and then turns into somewhat negative, dark, emotional etc etc being that is not strange at all its a normal response to an abnormal situation and in order for the mind of this individual to cope it endured and then released the locks and BAM now we have an emotionally damaged individual who will just because of abnormal and absurd shit gets labeled as an "emo" with all that it means. people have a need to relate to other people just lika any other pack animal, and poof now we have the "townies" (for example) a gang of people who have been through shit and got emotionally damaged during their childhood and that is a pretty strong bond to have i mean when i was like 12 my only friend then said that he lived with his mom and not both and i naturally just like the sky is blue thought and said "oh so he hit her huh" and he jsut stared at me and said "no are you stupid!?" so when i found other who had a shit childhood and i finally didnt have to feel weird i was so relieved adn felt like a part of something (i used to be a townie and i know all to well how it felt when i finally had people to relate to it was awesome more awesome than any antidepressant ever could make me feel infact i stopped with antidepressants while i hanged with them), i dont care what people who keeps puking the word "emofuck" think. they who do not understand the darker subcultures will never understand since they do not know or can comprehend how it was created under dark circumstances (im not trying to be all edgy or anything im just stating facts) and many bands who are considered emo also has dark pasts (are you who use emo as a slur seeing a pattern yet?) so in conclussion by using the word emo as a slur and laugh at it like its something funny you just prove that you have had a to happy life to know how it feels to be totally fucked in the head from an early age...
This is agreeable. I shall assist in the clarification, emo, by definition has no bearing on ones lifestyle. A simple subculture of people who choose to like and take part in emotional works. A common misconception is that all or most emos are cutters, highly incorrect. I myself am not emo, however i am a cutter, and i find it to be quite annoying when the two are grouped together when they themselves, have separate definitions and underlying circumstances. So thank you for beginning something i should have taken part in a time long ago.
So, the UK's left the EU. Was this a good idea or not?
They don't exist at all, the closest thing we have to a vampire are lawyers.
Of course witches exist. Werewolves, no. Vampires, maybe. I somewhat believe they do and call me stupid but my reason is that tales of vampires probably originated from some unfortunate occurences. Perhaps they didn't stay as hidden as they do now 800 years ago, and after some mishaps decided to stay in hiding.
witches exist (met one myself funny story actually) vampires exist just not in the way people might think (i have seen proof of vampirism but in the form of energy vampires) werewolves no they do not exist the thing that people in the middleages has described was most likely a direwolf they do not exist anymore though (although they could exist in places such as apalachia mountains or any other deep heavy forested area) and furthermore on the topic of witches the one i met she was a friends mother and when we walked through the door in to her kitchen she sat by the kitchen table drinking coffee when she saw me and my friend walking in and she said hi and asked me if i knew i had people with me, and i asked what she meant and she said (and remember this is the first time we met) she said yes you have 4 german soldiers following you around and there was no way she could have known that i collect old nazi germany artefacts, and she exlpained that my aura was grey and then she explained that she was a wiccan and i had read about them before so i was a little bit educated in it so we discussed it for a bit so yeah that was a bit awesome :)
And how do you know she wasn't just making all this up?
Maybe your friend told her about the collection or yours? Maybe it was just a guess?
i do not tell just anyone about my collection. i only tell a select few and do not allow anyone in the vicinity of the collection due to the "offensive" nature of it

and so you mean she nailed the very specific comment german soldiers? its not something you just guessits very weird to just make up from nowhere, and i know that germans are haunting me since i even have video proof now (i have one more vid but my girlfriend has it and in that my cat is chasing the orbs)
I had a wiccan phase and I thought a spell to make me a vampire really worked. I thought I was a vampire for at least a month.
Let's see that one, then.
I'm referring to the video Gas mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPFZOZ1wfQ
I don't see anything.
Wait until nearly the end, little red dots of light fly across the screen
Nope, still don't see anything.
i am actually trying to get stir up something as we speak and im getting relevant intelligent answers when i ask questions and i even invited the ehtity to sit here besides me and watch youtube so i got the answer befriend through the emf based vocalized ghost voice thing i have and i also asked can you knock and said please and knocked on the wall just to show and then it knocked twice right next to me and im in a basement no neighbouring rooms. and since i stirred things up (wich allways happen i might add)i have gotten pounding headache and a bit well it almost feels like you wake up from a party and are dried out and dizzy and the room im currently in has dropped to so low that i must wear a jacket and hoodie (and here we had 35 degrees today) and im sitting here in a jacket and hoodie

the thing im refering to is a program you can use to pick up electromagnetic pulses wich means it can catch voices not audible by the naked ear and that program picks up on these inaudible voices and on the screen it comes up what the supposed voice said and if it is relevant and not gibberish it is considered unexplained and thus paranormal you can for example ask questions and point to pics as me and my gf did we pulled up pics of jesus and it said stigmata wich was very fucking specific and then we showed a pic of hitler and it said leader so yeah cassettes thats basically what it is
Hold up, a program that detects shit related to electromagnetic interference? Is there any extra hardware needed?
nope you just need a relatively new phone in the upper priceranges i use a windows phone (dont know if its just the expensive ones with more stuff in it but my w8 phone works as one) my w8 phone can when i install a emf program efectively use its ability to pick up electromagnetic evergies from taking something as basic as phonecalls and turns it into a emf device that can detect inaudible emf signatures and shows it in words on my screen so basically it detects voices in the same way phonecalls work and in order to test it you can do as i did and ask question and if you get relevant answers and responses it is likely it is a paranormal fluctuation
Yup, yup, it's probably bullshit.
ok your opinion
They don't exist at all, the closest thing we have to a vampire are lawyers.
Of course witches exist. Werewolves, no. Vampires, maybe. I somewhat believe they do and call me stupid but my reason is that tales of vampires probably originated from some unfortunate occurences. Perhaps they didn't stay as hidden as they do now 800 years ago, and after some mishaps decided to stay in hiding.
witches exist (met one myself funny story actually) vampires exist just not in the way people might think (i have seen proof of vampirism but in the form of energy vampires) werewolves no they do not exist the thing that people in the middleages has described was most likely a direwolf they do not exist anymore though (although they could exist in places such as apalachia mountains or any other deep heavy forested area) and furthermore on the topic of witches the one i met she was a friends mother and when we walked through the door in to her kitchen she sat by the kitchen table drinking coffee when she saw me and my friend walking in and she said hi and asked me if i knew i had people with me, and i asked what she meant and she said (and remember this is the first time we met) she said yes you have 4 german soldiers following you around and there was no way she could have known that i collect old nazi germany artefacts, and she exlpained that my aura was grey and then she explained that she was a wiccan and i had read about them before so i was a little bit educated in it so we discussed it for a bit so yeah that was a bit awesome :)
And how do you know she wasn't just making all this up?
Maybe your friend told her about the collection or yours? Maybe it was just a guess?
i do not tell just anyone about my collection. i only tell a select few and do not allow anyone in the vicinity of the collection due to the "offensive" nature of it

and so you mean she nailed the very specific comment german soldiers? its not something you just guessits very weird to just make up from nowhere, and i know that germans are haunting me since i even have video proof now (i have one more vid but my girlfriend has it and in that my cat is chasing the orbs)
I had a wiccan phase and I thought a spell to make me a vampire really worked. I thought I was a vampire for at least a month.
Let's see that one, then.
I'm referring to the video Gas mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPFZOZ1wfQ
I don't see anything.
Wait until nearly the end, little red dots of light fly across the screen
Nope, still don't see anything.
i am actually trying to get stir up something as we speak and im getting relevant intelligent answers when i ask questions and i even invited the ehtity to sit here besides me and watch youtube so i got the answer befriend through the emf based vocalized ghost voice thing i have and i also asked can you knock and said please and knocked on the wall just to show and then it knocked twice right next to me and im in a basement no neighbouring rooms. and since i stirred things up (wich allways happen i might add)i have gotten pounding headache and a bit well it almost feels like you wake up from a party and are dried out and dizzy and the room im currently in has dropped to so low that i must wear a jacket and hoodie (and here we had 35 degrees today) and im sitting here in a jacket and hoodie
he is trolling again

The nazis have still existed regardless if the book is there or not. And what's so bad about Hitler when Stalin is 50x worse?
Mein Kampf shouldn't be censored -- it should be completely uncensored so we can understand history from the perspective of Hitler himself to its fullest.. History has already been written so there's no point in trying to censor non-fictional words that have had a played a giant role in terms of historical events.
I agree.
b0ss said:
from the perspective of Hitler himself
Got a point there, I think he means directly from Hitler however, The very source of the Public Perspective of Nazi Germany.
Well... No. Everyone was thinking this stuff, Hitler just put it into words. This perspective was around probably quite a while before Hitler even wrote Mein Kampf.
With Automation on the rise and Machines replacing jobs and serving as a means to more production and efficiency, Do you think we would shift from being souly a capitalist Society to becoming more of an Automated Society where a majority of Human work is Working on the machines, Scholars, And higher up jobs involving leadership, The jobs we want, and Ect.

here is a vid from 1st of may this year it shows the nordic resistance movement that has ever since our government opened the floodgates of massimigration grown to extreme proportions considering that its a scandinavian group
note that 1st of may in sweden is the workers day and usually this means that all the red parties such as the leftists dmeonstrate but this year it was historic since this year the only hting you can hear is a towering "ut med packet" wich means out with the pack and the pack meaning imigrants (they also say in the megaphone "fight against the traitors of the people and wordlbanks!" and the thing is the people around them cheers and screams with them "ut med packet" and you can only hear 1 single countervoice of a girl screaming "naziswine!" and you can also see how everyone just looks at her like she is from mars and is retarded, this is the bieproduct of uncontrolled massimigration

i remember this clusterfuck and from this the azov battalion was born, pushing into russia remarkably efficient and i must say i have both read and watched many documentaries about this and its legitimacy and i must say ukraine has my vote since putin sees himself as a reincarnation of some russian emperor (forgot the name) and therefore he is hellbent on reforming the russia that was, and that very much includes ukraine, here is a vid of the battallion not many knows about that fights under the wolfsangel and black sun htey are neonazis and extremely efficient not unlike the waffen ss and this is putins fault he should not have burst in crimea like that now he has azov biting him in the ass and they may even get us support i heard, so then russia will have a force to fear right in their own backyard wich they owe entirely to putins warmongery (its good footage but if you cant stand the music just mute it)

hmm damn son. that sucks :S i have been there to mate. and i know its rly hard. but you have to go on. find some cool things you can do with your friends and stuff. try to find some distraction. eventually it will be alright and you will find some even better girl who you deserve :D
Act on all the bad thoughts ur having that's my best tip also she probably broke up with you because of that spelling am I right HA uhhh haha YEAHHH...
I've been in that kind of situation before. And I decided to cut my hair short instead of cutting myself just so I could get his attention, but meh.. Life must go on. It's never ok to self harm, plus if she decided to be with that person, then let it be. Fate is giving you another chance to find a better lady. Well, it might seems hard to move on but believe me, you'll be able to do it soon.
I am in a very similar situation as well. There's this thing I've always said, it was "if I could name all of the things in my life that could ruin my life, I'd spend my whole life trying to name them." What do you think that means Teddy Guy95?
I'll. Date u
It's sad, I see my teachers, more than most of my family.
:C i am sorry
Let us spread this like wildfire. i will start here. on my Site :P
Any facebook blogs and such should also be relayed.
Its messed up how that happened and she made you feel that way for stuff like that :C
RIDICULOUSLY TRUE.
islamists are allowed to be in total control of the housing and have pretty fucking transparent given 3 years of apartments to isis supporters who goes to syria and then comes back to rest, this islamist (wich i have said since 1 year back) was caught redhanded in the isis cookiejar and got sacked when they started digging and at once found that he had been in extensive contact with islamists and prominent isis recruiters and to top it all of he was caught on a dinner with extremist jew haters, all this could be proven by glancing at his life but since we live in a world where thw word racist have the same weight as witch had in the 1600s so he has been happily supplying isis soldiers with jobs and apartments, 2 things that should go to the swedes who stands here with empty hands, so im ashamed of living in a country where an islamist isis supporter can be the minister of housing...
and people wonder why a civil war is brewing in the north
DAMN! Calm down yo, I'm from Sweden u know
Whats your guys thoughts on guns?
They're shit.
how
It's easy to kill someone with one.
yeah but think if someone was trying to kill you you could fire back in self defence.
They'd still be able to shoot you with ease, injured or not.
not always
Not always, but often.
Wonderful.
wow me and cassettes finally agree on something. I'm absolutely shocked.
Well. Shit.
I like having them but i doub't id ever have to use them on someone unless They went out of their way to tresspass on my property or mean to cause harm.
So you believe that causing someone physical harm, and possibly killing them, is a reasonable response to someone getting into your house?
yep.
If they intend to harm me then yes.
Harm you to what degree?
lethal harm to potentially injure or Kill.
"lethal harm to potentially injure"
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
I think your just trying to fuck with me as you do everyone else.
No, really, that made no sense.
Here's what I really think about the second amendment to the US constitution.
"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
While that first part is true, the bill of rights (first 10 amendments) was adopted in 1791. In 1791 people didn't break into public facilities (schools, hospitals, whatever) to shoot innocent people. Plus, assault weapons didn't exist either.

And yes, anyone who breaks into buildings, or kills innocent people for no reason should not have a gun.

But in this day and age it's too easy for them to obtain guns. That's the problem.
I own few guns but i have a permint to own them.
If I collected weapons it'd definitely be katanas, not guns lol
i have two AR-15s,4 9 milameter pistols,.22 pistol,few shotguns,3030 lever action rifle and thats bout it.
I think if someone has a Felony then yeah. kiss your gun goodbye
yeah luckly im clean as a whistle.
Well, someone could easily look sane until they get their gun. And what's to say people won't steal guns?
Capitalism is not perfect, but if you look at history Socialism never worked :3
Hmm... Not sure. I wonder what you think Sarah.
lol xD me either and I've always said we should be able to process our opinions in just a few words
Yep.
am i being to complex for you guys? XD
Nope. I don't know which is better.
I personally think Capitalism is becuase of the efficiency it brings. Socialism is nice... till you run out of peoples money.
Hmmm.. Isn't there a middle path?
There always is.
Mhm?
Then that's my road.
Oh which one is best for weed? That one.
a UK president once said that: Socialism is nice... till you run out of peoples money.
I think it was a parliament member a women idk her name xD
duuuuuude you gotta tell me.

UNIT SPAM!

well i must add none is good in its purest form there needs to be a balance wich havent been pulled of by a single country as of yet so im not keeping my hopes up, if u go all the way red everything for some reason turns into a giant clusterfuck of genocide and if we go all the way to the right we once again have been thrown into a giant clusterfuck of genocide so the trick is the middle but like i said it seems to be nearly impossiblefor a country to maintain that balance. in the end a country allways turns either left or right, the scales tips all the way to the left or right. it never stays in the perfect zen mode of the middleground, wich is a extreme pity

We need Communism!
Wolfrik...i hope you are a troll since communism is pure putrid warm garbage. Do you even know what it  is? Or is your understanding of the communist regimes based on youtube vids of "hellmarches" wich you thought looked cool. The communist system is a system that once established is destined to collapse hard sooner or later. The regime started by Lenin began as promise of gold and prosperity for all (wich all dictatorships promise its kinda their calling card to promise the heavens n give you hell)  then stalin (who didn't even qualify as a successor to Lenin, infact Lenin specifically told them DO NOT PUT STALIN IN CONTROL but the successor that Lenin wanted was erased from history by stalin and hounded to Mexico where he met a fatal "accident") communism is a system wich believes in "all people work equally for the cause" wich is ludicrous and insane a garbage man does not do as much of a contribution to society as for example a person working on hightech missile systems. I used to hang with alot of different people who all had carried opinions (ofc) on how a society should be ran and all of the people who stated that communism was awesome was the following druggies, alcoholics, or a combination of both have you even seen the system that made soviet crash n burn in the 90s? It's called plan economy and is insane fun fact the only nations in the world where at one time or another in the 1900s cannibalism was common was the ussr, china, and northkorea now what does all of these countries have in common? So I suggest that you check the death toll of your beloved communism before making short provocative statements such as that.
Communism is a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. We need a Communist government!
and how has that utopian vision worked out? you cant go around saying a theory wich is utopian in nature is awesome since not a single country ever has been able to implement it without turning the country into a dictatorship hell where genocide is everyday business you want to know what in all of humankinds history has taken most lives?! 1st place religion 2nd place communism...the nrs speaks for themselves. you cant use a book and theoretical idea from karl marx as proof that communism is awesome you need to look a the cold hard facts and where its been put into practice and in conclussion i can write a book where everyone has infinite money and call it bullshitism and say its an ideology but since its in words in a book on paper that is not proof that its the best ideology ever since its just a glorified fairytale. so your short response did not answer my question but instead made me all the more certain that you havent even read about communism let alone my post. or you just ignored my facts i threw in your face. a red state is pure chaos just look at my country sweden we are at the brink of martial law, our government is putting together a crisis package for when swedens system falls, we have rightwing extremism going stronger than ever before, we have a small civilwar going on between islamists and and radicalnationalists, asylumcenters going up in flames each day bombs and firebombs planted on buildings, terror attack threats more and more frequently, a government that monitors and prosecutes all who oppose our red government, if you dare speak out against our government you get prosecuted and labeled a threat to democracy. sweden right now is the very definition of a communist state under different name. so dont come and say that communism is great i live in the shit and its fucking NOT!
U.S. before socialism: give me liberty or give me death

U.S. with socialism: give me free stuff or I'll cry about it
If you think Communism is good, just look at the difference between west and east Europe
And ex Communist countrys are far worst then USA and Canada
Russia and secret Communist Putin are the best!
Wolfrik I'm sorry to say this but you are embarrassing yourself not only do you think that quoting a book is proof that communism is great.  You also blatantly avoid answering my response to your last post wich is incredibly disrespectful. If you even took your time reading my post about communist Sweden you would think twice about communism being great. communism is the black plague of politics and ideologies. And if you are going to continue throwing out illconceived dumb responses to peoples genuine thoughtworthy posts you can just stop right now. The only thing you effective make happen with your posts and responses is causing annoyance and embarrassing yourself
Wolfrik if you are going to argue don't insult people who put time in answering you with quotes from a biased book. This would be like proving to non nazis that nationalsocialism is great by quoting mein kampf. You need to be critical of the source that you take your info from. It's something I learned in highschool in a course in how propaganda is the most lethal weapon of all .so if you are going to continue please make solid statements that are backed by facts and not wishfull thinking.
And wolfrik if you want to battle about knowledge of fascism and communism and other totalitarian regimes be my guest I have studied fascism and communism inside n out since i was 15 so the insultingly simplified statement from that book "one one side stood Hitler and fascism with the myth of German supremacy" if that is your understanding of nationalsocialism and its extremely complex way of growing from seemingly nothing then I urge you to read for a couple of years and then when you have read about everything from the October revolution to the forming of the nsdap and have a full understanding of the inner workings of both regimes. Then you are ready to argue and if you will answer these posts I have made now. Posts wich I have put time to send to you to explain things to you so you can better understand how things realy is  with a dumb answer such as "communism is best my family loves communism!"  then I have no more to say other than I hope you get to taste communism so you know how wrong you are.
I read everything you wrote. I simply disagree which I have a right to do and have a right to my own opinion. I am not going to fight to prove which one of us is right or wrong. I simply like things one way and you like things the other which we both have a right to. So I respect your opinion as I hope others may mine.
so you just blatantly avoid the fact that sweden where i live, is on the brink of becoming a state of emergency because of communist values.
No I was trying to be respectful towards your opinion and avoid a fight.
but you are avoiding it since i asked how it can be good when everything it touches turns to shit, my country before the communist lovers stepped into power was a prosperous country where everyone had enough to be happy n thensome everyone had a home a apartment a job now fastforward to 2016 and all has gone to shit now noone has a job noone has an apartment sweden is bankrupt and islamists and radicalnationalists battle it out in the streets in a kind of civil war, and all because of communism and this harm communism has done to my country to make it into a giant state of emergency with civil war and the whole package was done in less than 15 years
YOU'RE EMOS. YOUR MENTAL CAPACITY IS TOO SMALL TO HANDLE SUCH TOPICS AS POLITICS.
Communism (at least how I see it) fights corruption, apathetic behavior, and encourages work ethic to increase. I know that Communism has failed in the past several times, but I still believe it to be the best government for a Society.
so in conclussion you believe in something that has failed miserably 100% of the time and an ideology that killed over 100 million people and believes a country can use the useless system of planeconomy? the very same system that helped bring down the entire crumbling house of cards that is a communist regime? you believe in something that has never worked in history ever, and you keep pointing to a utopian fantasy to use as proof, a fantasy that is just that. it would be great if everyone lived happily everafter and everyone was rich but its a naive fantasy that has never and will never work. i as said in previous posts live in communism 2.0 the same system that goes under the name "demokratur" in swedish and elected dictatorship in english a state that maintains the illusion of freespeech but underthe facade its a tightly controlled ruthless dictatorship where all of media is controlled by extremeleftists and internet is being monitored to see that noone trashtalks the ruling party and if they do they send people to their homes to be reeducated (i was threatened with reeducation when i questioned our government nad was forced to appologise and then i only got a reprimand) that is communism 2.0 its still here and its as tyrannical as ever but now the red menace is hidng under the disguise of a hollow democracy
Just like Russia! I get it, a lot of you think no its a dumb idea but this is a great idea everyone being equal, what did your teachers teach you in kindergarten when you thought you were better than the rest?! We are all equal! Take north Korea for example king Jung un thinks he is better than everyone else he has taken over north Korea and brained washed them to praise him. Sick. No cellphones, poor health, and almost no one walks on the streets! With a communist county we will be equal. Just think how great that would be! Canada is known for how nice it is... Its a communist country!!! Duhhhh

Cool thanks guys I will have to check those out later this week.
Sarahvisarinafage that ideology sounds like a highly functional and interesting one I have never heard about it before. That sounds like a ideology that I can stand behind according to me since humans in nature needs a spur to develop and evolve technology and  other revolutionary things. That is why people need a capitalist system so a success ladder is there to encourage progress and evolution of tech etc etc so that they who do that get rewarded for it and the socialist system so that everyone has a decent living even when they are looking for work (not a giant sum but enough to make ends meet and still enough to buy things so they can still live a happy life)  and the socialist part would also prevent crime since everyone has enough to live good lives buut those who wants to contribute and develop groundbreaking things gets muuuch money
I am the one who invented it, The philosphy in practice is indeed highly Functional, Its a brand new philosphy still in the making, Ive been leading a group that has been disadvantaged due to me being in highschool.

Margaret Tatcher lol I just typed the end of the sentence and her name popped up everywhere
Cool like the Soviet Union but the people get to own a gun.
Its different from a Communist System, People get to own Private land, Private companies, Ect. Capitalism in itself is a model for basic functions of Infrastructure and government. Socialist aspects include the representation of the Individual, where the People's Rights and Government intervention come in. During the Soviet Era im not sure if LGBT rights were represented, I have done research, LGBT may not have been persecuted but signifigantly didnt have all of the Laws that were needed. Prostitution was deemed Illegal in the Soviet Union, and Many of these Pro Nexan Points that have been made would probably be opposed by the USSR.
Not trying to be a smart alec, But im just sayin its probably not like the Soviet Union.

First of all, it's Geneva. Second, the Stanford Prison experiment shows us that once given power, people will become violent/manipulative/sadistic/etc, so your "A leader is entitled to his or her Society, and is given The power he or she needs to do the job assigned to them. They are here to serve the people. Not the Rich, the corporate, or Dictators" allows for plenty of human rights violations and such.

Well its good to know your a decent debater when It comes to it.
I personally think its the person (And also what the person can and can't do), Anyone can be a great leader or a tyrant, Sometimes there are people that have been great leaders AKA Teddy Rosevelt, however theres also Men such as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. Good men and Evil men are in High places. A wise man once said that a man has two wolves in his soul, A black one that is full of anger and regret, Murderous desirs and mans Lower self, The other a white wolf full of mans higher self, Love and compassion, a desire to serve the human race rather than themselves, these two wolves were constantly in battle, The one who wins this battle, is wich wolf we choose to feed.
Figure it out.

I'VE BEEN AT IT FOR A WHILE NOW. IT'S RIDICULOUSLY CRYPTIC. BORDERING ON OUTRIGHT AUTISTIC, IN FACT.
. .-.. .-.. -.-- --- ..- .-. .--- ..- ... - --. --- -. -. .- .... .- ...- . - --- - .-. -.-- .... .- .-. -.. . .-. --- ..- .-- .- -. - -.-. .-. -.-- .--. - .. -.-. --- ..- --. --- - .. -
So very cyrptic, i wish I was that Cryptic. XD
Yep.
Mhm.
The comment about the wolves is not a quote, it's an old Cherokee parable.
Exactly. Not the most cryptic message out there.
Either way, it still makes no sense.
The implication is that everyone has the potential to be good or bad, it's a matter of which emotions you allow to dictate your actions that shapes who you are.
Oh okay then
I use big words often, Im sorry.
Bit of a twat, aren't you?
No?....
Sure...
I honestly seek to help people and make people make them feel better about themselves as a hobby, I want to make it into a career one day.
I remember your whole "ISIS chemical weapons" claim. You spread an article that is almost undoubtedly propaganda. And yet you say you want to help people. By scaring them.
i dont want to say anyone is right or wrong here but i can say that there is proof that isis have nuclearweapons or at the very least have all they need to make them, several finds in overtaken isis towns hints at exactly that, so that is not propaganda people should be scared if they think its all fine and nothing is wrong then they will not be on guard, they will keep thinking that "oh but that is just the news that never happens to me" until it fuckin does so isis nuke story is not propaganda its just put in a way to make news sell, such as they have the materials and intentions to make nukes but we dont know if they already have but we know that they will. and as i said stories about isis horrifying shit should be spread far and wide here in sweden we have had several attacks on schools and such with slogans praypainted on the walls such as "christian pigs convert or die the caliphate is coming!" and another was when a whole 2 meter tall brick wall was spraypainted with the isis flag so yeah isis shit should be posted everywhere and people should always have in the back of their mind that those fuckers are walking amongst us
It's blatant fearmongering, though. MAD exists, and everyone, even Al-Shitface knows this.
Oh, by the way, improve your fucking grammar. You've a wall of text there, seperate it into a couple paragraphs, maybe. Possibly introduce capital letters.
oh im sorry mr grammar nazi i wasnt aware that it was a necessity to be gramatically correct, perhaps you dont write with your feelings but i do when i write about things and topics that touches what i burn for...my mind spits out the words and when the words keep popping out in lines forming sentences i cant stop the momentum to check for a comma or a capital letter, it fucks with my rythm and the text.
its kinda like being in a race speeding up and going faster and faster then you cant pay attention to red lights or signaling right or left you just do! you dont stop to make the text more grammatically correct it as said before fucks with the rythm and the weight of the text it comes out in a chunk and that is how it leaves my mind. so if you cant handle that to bad but dont come dragging with the allmighty (but putrid old and rotten) grammar argument.
and cassette you are the guy who interrupted a serious debate a couple of days ago with childish emo slurs so if you are going to bash on the tired old grammar drum you cant go and write things like that, your credibility and the respect people will have towards in a discussion with you kinda dives straight into a cliff when you do that.
and why do you consider something that is proven and true to be fearmongering? its vital that everyone knows the severity of the situation europe and the rest of the free world stands infront of and that something is a dark chasm of putrid shit consisting of radicalislam nad if people keeps pretending that all is well and people like you keeps calling every warning or heads up a "fearmongering tactic" then can you please explain to me would you tell the man that is shitting on your livingroom carpet to get the fuck out, kick his ass and call the cops or would you look at him turn around and watch tv upstairs since he will propably go away in due time. hte problem wont go away isis will be there no matter if you close your eyes or not no matter how much you call it fearmongering its not fearmongering its an uncomfortable truth.

Then write down a draft, and afterwards, refine it. You illiterate wanker.
why are you insisting on reffering to said grammar card? its a proven fact that when someone doesnt have shit to say and knows it they will point to the grammar card.
Uh... Proven? Cite your sources, buddy.
Also, I'm just noting because it's making the text hard to read.
do you think i have the time or even realy care since my pc is set to swedish setting wich means it will not follow english rules it will follow swedish grammar rules where some things differ in the way a sentence and such is put together, the only thing i might agree on is the capital letter and the comma thing but i dont have the time or the will to do it since i dont care.
My point remains the same: They're fearmongering.
Fear mongering?

Because reporting on Terrorism is fearmongering...

Because telling someone what a group that is an actual fearmonger is Fearmongering.

Lmao mate.
We have that hatred in us?
well but its not the west who screams about allah and infidel this blow up that, its the crazy batshitinsane islamists who obviously possess such hatred. we in the west just wants to NOT getting blown up and as a result of islamists hellbent on turning the west into an islamic state we have to take action and go over there to make them stop but when we do that they whine about that so its not the west who possess any hatred towards the muslim world its the muslim world who wants to turn our countries into vasalstates to a global islamic state.
Yeah fuck that. nobody needs that kind of crap.

Not trying to be against muslims, but man, Its a religion I despise.
You mean Wahhabism, you cockmunch. Also gas is an obvious troll.
FreeBird, your general actions are that of a twat, but your political views are pretty damn good.
excuse me?! cassettes... can you carefully explain to me how i am a troll? and why you believe a word such as "cockmunch" is necessary. you obviously dont know shit about anything that is todays political climate so unless you have other things than profanitys and baseless accusations to say, please....be quiet.
Gas is someone whos very into debating as I can see. I find his Arguments interesting.
I hope one day you'll all take a lesson from the internet and learn not to feed the trolls. It gets pitiful to watch after a while.
cassettes oh never mind looked at your age and you are clearly NOT mature enough to argue in a debate such as this one for gods sake! 2002 you are 13! what can you possibly know about politics or the isis situation. but i suspected this when you started spewing out "cockmunch" and the like, so if you are going to act like a 13 year old dont bother posting in a serious debate.

Not directly but it does show a good example of what happens when you feed trolls.

In all fairness, you probably shouldn't be using the younger generation of this era as an example of being able to adapt to new ideas. It's half the reason that SJWs exist today.
Oh god, SJWs are bad news. Scratch that, very shitty news.
no i am reffering to the numerous comments that is nothing but namecalling in a debate about capitalism or socialism and i wanted him to share with the group rather than say things such as "cockmunch" and actually contribute instead of effectively being nothing but deadweight,
and saying "i know things" doesnt make it so, so the only thing i wanted him to do before i got irritated and called him out for his apparent lack of knowledge was to actually tell us and contribute to this debate with his view and knowledge if he has any since that was kinda the whole idea of this thread, a debate not a contest in namecalling. i am realy tired of people who destroy serious debate threads with namecalling and dumb comments such as "you are emos you dont understand etc etc" dont remember the whole thing but it was about 5 repetitions of it and then he accuses me of being a troll when all i have been doing is debating in a debate thread about political systems. so if anything he is the troll
Poor grammar. Poor spelling. Unwillingness to understand one's point. Responding to ad hominem with insults...
YOU'RE AN OBVIOUS TROLL, MATE.
I'm referencing FreeBird, actually. And sympathy for the ideologies you listed are on rise because the media is exaggerating the power and threat of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh.
By the way, if you want to make any coherent arguments and thus engage in a debate, I implore you to improve your english.
The three names thing was just for a laugh. And you're the one pulling the obvious bullshit, mate. Multicultralism does not neccesarily result in integrating Islam into everything. It's simply respecting other's cultures to some degree.
Sarah, do you see just how much right-wing hogwash this guy's pulling out of his ass?
"rightwing" i am pointing out several truths not "hogwash" you ignorant little shit! if you knew anything about the current situation you would see that what i have written is nothing but the truth but again you avoid the questions you dumb little kid
No, I'm not avoiding questions. I actually answered your question about why right-wing ideologies are increasing in popularity fairly straightforward, if I say so myself.
Also, isn't it interesting how you criticize me of insulting others, and then call me names such as "Ignorant little shit" and "dumb little kid"?
but i also told you that you where wrong and you didnt even respond to that and you are avoiding questions no matter what you say it doesnt change the fact that you are a classic avoider much like the politicians of todays "democracies"
so i say this since you cant get it into your thick skull that its NOT fearmongering if its true and isis is NOT blown out of proportion so can you answer me why you are not answering any of the questions about why gays are being slaughtered in sweden in a ancient muslim ritual with a snake around their neck and why we currently have over 50 no go zones in my country so can you please tell me how you can think that multiculturalism is "respecting other's cultures to some degree." do islam respect us NO do they tolerate our way of life NO do they care that we do not allow sharia law NO do they care that we are a democracy that do not look at a woman as a piece of meat NO as paul joseph watson said "some cultures are better than others"
so im done with you and your volatile sewage of a comment each one proves that you are so far up your own ass its almost scary.
and you cant say that you told me since you where WRONG on all accounts.
Kek. You're a pitiful, brainwashed numbskull. But okay, let's call it quits.
IT'S BEEN FUN, MATE.
likewise brainwashed little pc robot
Freebird, I have for quite some time, And its kind of shocking how in depth it is. look gas Im not one to hate you or backstab, but damn. Have you considered Observing other views other than your own?
Abosolutely true Gas.
yes so i am fully aware of other peoples points of view its just that when i see a menacing force such as isis i immediately lock my eyes on it and do not let it out of sight because they are dangerous they are a force that is pure evil and they are most certainly NOT blown out of proportion, and the reason why i react so strongly when cassettes say such things is that i live in a country where a radical islamist is minister of housing (mehmet kaplan) he has been caught at a meeting for radical islamists sitting infront of the black banner of the taliban (it was a bit unreal to see our minister of housing in such a position) so when cassettes sits here and tries to tell me that i am wrong even though i live in it i get pretty defensive, i have drawn conclussions that the current quran is to be compared to a bible from the 1600s that is when the texts are the most similar and the most radical, and during that time my sweden was a force that swept across europe and spread fear under Karl XII and his caroelans that was fanatical about christianity and can be compared to islamists such as isis (the russians feared them since they never ran into battle they quiettly and firmly walked up to the russians until they could see the white of hteir eyes and then they attacked while screaming and looking like the devil himself the russians feared the caroleans very much for their fanticism and willingness to die) the caroleans and islamists can be compared in more ways than one so i urge you to read abit about both and you to will see the similarities between them :) its very fascinating material actually, so i think we must see what made us dropthe fantaicism and try to implement that same (or atleast a similar) approach to deradicalise and remove religion as a fundamental pillar in the muslim world it would be good for both technological advances and social since more tourists and such would dare go to the often very beautiful landscapes that is in the middleeast :)
And you talk about it. :')
cassettes i live here why the fuck would someone take your word for it over me who LIVE here so here is a few of the sites he has been caught being a islamist on
http://nyheteridag.se/miljopartisten-mehmet-kaplan-jamfor-jihad-med-kamp-for-demokrati/
(its in swedish but it talks about the thing where mehmet said "jihad is a fight for democracy")
and the famous words where he said "swedes who goes to join isis is exactly like the swedes who went to fight for finland against russia in ww2"
http://stefanolsson.nu/2014/07/01/miljopartiet-liknar-jihadister-vid-frivilliga-under-finska-vinterkriget/
he has a huge file of material against him where his islamist connections are exposed
so cassettes read a little more than the wikipedia page ok.
and here is a english site
http://www.thelocal.se/20141014/former-swedish-mp-calls-minister-an-islamist
http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/10/21/swedish-pm-under-fire-for-appointing-islamist-to-cabinet/
its not that hard to find the facts but since you obviously dont know shit i have done it for you now so please stop believeing that you know more about my own country and its current situation than me who LIVES there
I would take his word over yours anyday Gas...
You know, all you've shown this while is just plain Gas.... egoistic non sensical gas.
WHATTT???
Gas is the troll here...
He's the stupid fear monger.
Ok i didn't  realize that they where trolls since I haven't  had to deal with them for quite some time so I thought they where sincerely that naive. I'm used to discussing serious political topics without immature trolls interfering in the conversations. But I should have understood I guess but again I am used to discussing and debating in a serious environment and naturally I was drawn to the title "serious" and thus thought nothing about the possibility  of immature trolls wrecking it so I apologize for feeding the trolls I didn't  realize they where trolls
I vote highly liberal capitalism, which imitates socialism. Norway is a perfect example of it.
I'd have to agree.
This is an intersting Devolopement to hear.
I've kept my eye on the Refugee Crisis going on in Iraq and Syria, I have known there were anti Refugee groups but never thought that groups like this would of sprung.
Though i did see something about the Swedish Democrats. You've probably heard of them, a Nationalist movement that have said some pretty nasty things.
Apparently they are labeled as a far right movement despite being Democrats. I dont know much about the Geopolitical Situation in Sweden but I do know its taken a rough turn.
Wish UKIP was still had the media's attention. That would've been fun
the sweden democrats are not rightwingextremits infact the current leader is booting everyone who he deems being of the radical nature so far he has booted several of his inner circle, so the SD is taking sweden by storm and is right now the 2nd largest party in sweden, so next election everyone here thinks that the SD will win since everything they warned of has now happened and everything the current party said they would do they havent done so there is a kind of 1920 era germany thing going on here right now with communists battling it out in the open and in riots and radical nationalists mixed with diehard nazis battling it out in politics since they learned in the 90s that you wont win any election by behaving like a insane person wrecking shit spraypainting slogans on walls so they let the reds take bad press and they themselves do as hitler did in the 1930s he ordered the SA to stop fighting and threatening people and instead kept cool and quiet and waited til the right moment so its not the SD that is a threat they are infact the only party who actually could save sweden from going greece on itself (and we all know how that went with the golden dawn) so if sweden is to maintain control and rebuild its economy and prevent extremists from taking seats (wich they are now pure nazis are sitting in parliament seats in several places in sweden right now and all because of the immigration problems and my governmetns really insane way of handling things) the SD is needed
Very interesting. tell me more C:
How is this website even considered "social" when it's dead wtf???
It's only because it's late and like 80% of the people on here have bed times. xD
^or we just know we won't get good grades if we stay up till 2 am...just a thought
Last week my girlfreind commited suicide and I loved her sooo much. Do you think I should join her, im lost without her and ive started cutting again. :'(:'(
Join her? As much as you think your joining her you can't. You really think that little of your life to give it up for one person? You will have others.
I speak from experience on this sort of thing please don't hurt yourself
Hey, I know it is hard. I had one of my girlfriends commit sucide before. so, I understand. Pls don't do anything you will regret. If you need a friend or just someone to talk to you can talk to me. Through all darkness there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You just gotta be strong for her. If you give up, you will give up on her.
Don't join her. What you can do is be there for the people who cared about her. She'd want you to do that.
Hugs. 
rips
Yes join her
^You tryna give us all more reasons to hate the Undertale fandom?
M8 you are 13, you are not a badass.
I feel like I am better off dead. My ex cheated on me and made me do things with force. I just want someone to help me. I am tired of being hurt and used and beating down. My parents and me are fighting and feel like they care more about other things than me. Just sigh
Hey, If you want a friend to talk to just shoot me a message here or on kik @blind_follow. id be happy to listen or even just have a chat :)
aww thx. Means alot just alot of crap
I don't mind, I'm a good listener.

Your welcome
I feel like I should be dead. I feel so numb so alone.
I know the feeling, but hey at least now you have me to talk with
I am glad, I have you to talk to.
Do you have kik? it's just a bit easier to talk through since its on my phone
They used the A-bomb to end a war that would have never ended and Japan was about to use a biological weapon they've made to wipe out America. it was a war time so that's not a very good exemple.
Nearly every single war they took part since WW2 they were asked to do so by the countries in the UN, because no one else could do. So blaming them for doing so isn't right. They've went to Viet-nam because they were asked to do so, they've went to Corea because they were alsed to do so.
People should start fixing their own shit before blaming everything on America.
Japan wiped out China's forces with bioweapons. The war between japan and china was the biggest Biowarfare ever made. And they were making one to kill tons of Americans.
P.S. I've studied biochemistry and statistic at university. Bio-weapons are a thing for a very long time already and they were used in many occasions.
Sorry but stop playing the victim when you aren't
As for middle east. Sorry but problems started way before americans and UN involvement, it's mainly a religion and fanatism problem. And they keep lying to themself thinking it started in the 80s while it started way over a century ago.
I think people love to blame America because they've made a succesful economy at first. And most uneducated people tend to blame their problems on succesful people instead of working on solutions.
You can keep playing the ostrich and fuel more hatred or start finding solutions.
I've studied at university and I love reading books instead of making pointless hateful rants.
Notice it isn't a rant, nor is it hatefull. Just a question. :P
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731
please do read this in detail. Japanese govt was wicked agreed. But nothing useful was found from the facility. Which university did you study from?
Japan was far from agreeing in anything, and no THIS is a hateful post.
Only thing is see is American this, American that. You bring no more substance than a homophobe going on a rant against what he hate. You only stated facts purely out of contexts and made them what you wanted, that's what's called propaganda and manipulation. Reality is, I think you have a problem, and you hate Americans.
I can only invite you to read books and start studying history instead of reading internet articles and wiki booklets.
oh another I hate Americans post! This is so original. wow
Cheerook it's pointless to argue with someone who just hate, don't try to use logic against him it will not work.
Don't hate man.... -.-. I really appreciate them. All I'm asking for is an opinion. I got Cherooks, so don't make it personal please.
I didn't said you've made false affirmations, I've said you've took them out of their context to make them say what you want. And that is propaganda And manipulation. it's always important to put yourself in the situation to understand the actions.
Let's just take the A-bomb for instance. Over 95% of the destruction of Japan during WW2 was done by conventional weapons and bombs. The was was cruel from both side, and it was getting close to final solution on both side. It's war time, it's cruel, it's reality. Americans were just faster to build their final solution.
I don't think Japan deserved being bombed like that no one deserve that. But it's war, and this is why the context is imporant. Japan started it with a surprise and unprovoked attack, thinking they would cripple the Americans. So things escalated and there was retaliations, and the military potential of America was far superior. So things escalated quickly and Japan started using chemicals weapons. And war is like that it's always like that, always escalating until someone do the worst. And that's how most wars end.
Oh chemical weapons??? Right... yeah. I see your logic. :)
I'm not touching this post with a 10 foot pole. Not worth the blood pressure at the moment
I would like to say one last thing:
Let's just imagine if someone said: ohhhh people in Iran are fucking fag they deserve to be burned to death we should nuke that country they should beg for mercy.
It would be horrible saying that, and everyone would call that guy a racist a murderer etc.
Somehow people act in a very similar hateful way at Americans, no don't try to find any excuses it is the very same thing. It's wrong. And this is why world isn't going well, people always seems to find logicals explanations for their hatred.
It is.
I think we can all agree no lasting civilization has ever kept peace before.
True that. :)
They used the A-bomb to end a war that would have never ended and Japan was about to use a biological weapon they've made to wipe out America. it was a war time so that's not a very good exemple.
Nearly every single war they took part since WW2 they were asked to do so by the countries in the UN, because no one else could do. So blaming them for doing so isn't right. They've went to Viet-nam because they were asked to do so, they've went to Corea because they were alsed to do so.
People should start fixing their own shit before blaming everything on America.
Japan wiped out China's forces with bioweapons. The war between japan and china was the biggest Biowarfare ever made. And they were making one to kill tons of Americans.
P.S. I've studied biochemistry and statistic at university. Bio-weapons are a thing for a very long time already and they were used in many occasions.
Sorry but stop playing the victim when you aren't
As for middle east. Sorry but problems started way before americans and UN involvement, it's mainly a religion and fanatism problem. And they keep lying to themself thinking it started in the 80s while it started way over a century ago.
I think people love to blame America because they've made a succesful economy at first. And most uneducated people tend to blame their problems on succesful people instead of working on solutions.
You can keep playing the ostrich and fuel more hatred or start finding solutions.
I've studied at university and I love reading books instead of making pointless hateful rants.
Notice it isn't a rant, nor is it hatefull. Just a question. :P
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731
please do read this in detail. Japanese govt was wicked agreed. But nothing useful was found from the facility. Which university did you study from?
Japan was far from agreeing in anything, and no THIS is a hateful post.
Only thing is see is American this, American that. You bring no more substance than a homophobe going on a rant against what he hate. You only stated facts purely out of contexts and made them what you wanted, that's what's called propaganda and manipulation. Reality is, I think you have a problem, and you hate Americans.
I can only invite you to read books and start studying history instead of reading internet articles and wiki booklets.
oh another I hate Americans post! This is so original. wow
Cheerook it's pointless to argue with someone who just hate, don't try to use logic against him it will not work.
Don't hate man.... -.-. I really appreciate them. All I'm asking for is an opinion. I got Cherooks, so don't make it personal please.
I didn't said you've made false affirmations, I've said you've took them out of their context to make them say what you want. And that is propaganda And manipulation. it's always important to put yourself in the situation to understand the actions.
Let's just take the A-bomb for instance. Over 95% of the destruction of Japan during WW2 was done by conventional weapons and bombs. The was was cruel from both side, and it was getting close to final solution on both side. It's war time, it's cruel, it's reality. Americans were just faster to build their final solution.
I don't think Japan deserved being bombed like that no one deserve that. But it's war, and this is why the context is imporant. Japan started it with a surprise and unprovoked attack, thinking they would cripple the Americans. So things escalated and there was retaliations, and the military potential of America was far superior. So things escalated quickly and Japan started using chemicals weapons. And war is like that it's always like that, always escalating until someone do the worst. And that's how most wars end.

The question is do we call them peace-keepers?
Jesus fucking christ no. America starts wars in the name of profit, hardly the sign of a peace-keeping nation.
My gf cheated for longer than half the relationship and idk what to do anymore I just want to die
I know the feeling bro, minus the cheating part but I had a nearly 3 year long relationship end today and I know the loss oh so well. I'm not as optimistic about my situation but I'm assuming you're a bit younger in which case you should really just try to hang in there. There's plenty of more bitches in the sea if you feel like dealing with the continual cycle of repeated heartbreak. Admittedly that doesn't sound so great but there's always a chance that you'll meet someone that you like better.
killing urself for a girl who doesnt even care for u in the beginning is not worth it.....trust me.....she wasnt for u.....ur prob an amazing person and she couldnt handle that.....im sorry....i know the feeling ive had 3 guys cheat on me already but ur worth better
I heard the Swedish Democrats recently are producing alot of anti Refugee stuff lately, Watched an entire documentary.
All the refugees are terrorist, and they say they will destroy America.
The maker of this post should reply in 24 hrs. Or else I am reporting this topic.
I watched the news, they were literally say ing "we will destroy you."

No offense to you though, you are cool.
I agree,  not everybody is evil.
See?
Read the Kuran and the Bible...
I follow the respect others, keep healthy part. But all of these monotheistic beliefs are kinda... violent right? I find it wierd. It's important to spread a message for them. I find that repulsive.
Christians are cool, in fact there god says NOT to hate ANYBODY. Their religion is founded off of love.
Those were the old style Roman Catholics, not exactly real Christians.
I see where you are coming from though, real Christians (those who live straight from the bible) would never hurt anyone.
They are both dumbasses, that is what I say, and racists.
Talking about MEMBERS of a religion, I don't think that's a good Idea cuz Anyone can pretend to be follower of a religion without obeying it even 1% !Just like terrorists who pretend to be Muslims while they never even read Qur'an :|I Think we should research about the roots and bases or every Ideology, The books for religions and Basics for non-religion Ideologies !
Exactly! not that I appreciate certain sections of it even after reading it. :)
I believe only in love, I believe that the world was founded on love.
Pretty cool, if love was the law, we'd all be free, and the bombing would stop.
People lack insight brother. They do not see. They are lost.
Love opens the souls eyes.

Let us hope that ISIS will be defeated in due time with Russia's aggression
ISIS are the West's operatives used as a boogeyman to scare the public. ISIS are funded by the US and are used as pawns in the zionist's game of world domination'The world is a stage'
Esadly you are right.
Yes, i have seen some evidence regarding that CIA operatives had trained ISIS in Libya or near Syria before all of this began, Funny how all of the equipment we gave to the Revolution against Khadaffi is now backfiring, it shatters my trust, Back in 2010 When The world was watching as Khadaffi was overthrown, I remember myself being in full support, i thought we were just overthrowing a simple dictator, but there is much more, so much more that i had not been aware of. later on ISIS rears it's head. Its very similar to the Nazi's Just in a different form, and Way shittier Technology.
Weather it be Zionist, Illuminati, Jewish, Freemason, Satanist or whatever group, Everyone is all about world domination it seems, I wish to colonize other planets to get away from all of this. It would be a modern Day Settlement, hopefully without all the slavery and Such.
The Zionist Jews are Satanist Freemasons. It's all one secret society. The Earth is flat and we can't go further than the moon it seems, especially with our current technology, so you'll struggle to colonize surrounding planets that are more than likely colonized as it is.
The world is flat? Many including myself would disagree.
Many would disagree before actually looking into any Flat Earth arguments. Your life starts when you let go of most things you were taught during your early years of indoctrination. I hope you've done research into this and aren't just batting it away without looking at the argument.

But things are really beautiful too!

Yeah that's what people would like you to believe, but the book itself is filled with hatred, slaughter, rape, sexism, and betrayal.
Plz tell me where in the bible it tells u to rape, hate, kill, be sexist toward, and betray people?
Oh boy. Oh fuckin' boy.
DIS GON B GUD
I dare YOU to actually read the entire bible, and study it deeply, then when you have done so, tell me what you think.

Agreeg, Vlahakis.
And about this :
"that's for God to decide (if God exists), and as for me, I wish all the good people will go to heaven regardless of religion, or without one"
I ensure you, Laws of The God I know work exactly that way. Unless I'm wrong and I couldn't know him really, which I don't think so.
Trouble is, you can't really invade ISIS, as they're not set up as a conventional national army or anything, but rather just a bunch of people who hold roughly the same idea.
Isis is being run by some sort of underground organization, they are trying to kill off the two most common religions, Christianity and Islam, so that they can introduce a new religion that everyone follows, it is all part of a plan to make the one world government / new world order.
FUCK OFF YOU CONSPIRACY THEORIST.
Wtf, glitch
EmoWire worsens any conditions people have, and turns then into huge attention whores. In that sense, EmoWire is highly successful.
Do you feel that Governments are a nessescity, Despite all of the Corruption, and ineffciency that has been seen, and the great tragedy it's capable of comitting. Do you feel we should have a government or not. Explain your answer of why you voted yes or no.
yes because I know way to many bad people. they just need a lot of work or we need to remember whats right and get people in it that feels the same way so there isn't so much chaos.
I agree with you, the way things have been run are bullshit.
Yes. It may not always work as intended, but there is no other alternative.
HELL TO DA NO!!!! If government wasn't so evil, than billions of families around the globe wouldn't have no money and food. I mean, and the whole system of money and debts. If these where never invented, the world would be happy. We wouldn't slave away at minimum wage jobs to get pieces of paper and pieces of metal. We could have stuck with the system of trade and growing crops to trade for animals and homes. And if the government didn't have stupid law's and drugs weren't traded for MONEY, my father wouldn't be in prison for LIFE!!!!!! I would be able to meet him. But no. The COURT ordered that I could never meet my father. Because he is too dangerous. Like I give a rats ass. He is being held in a GOVERNMENT facility slowly DYING because of really, really bad diabetes. He will never meet me. He will never be there the day I graduate from high school and college. He will not be there the day I get married or have kids. He won't be able to ever leave that prison ever. All because of the government. And money. And drugs. And gangsters. But I am not saying that we do not need police to stop those mother fucking gangsters who lured him and so many others into being murderous people. All for MONEY. And natural things like weed that shouldn't be illegal to people. He is like this BECAUSE OF THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT. In my opinion, they are the reason of at least 25% of crimes. Because the government. I'm sorry, but you said serious conversation. That's what I had. With myself mostly. But ya. ;) Bye!!!!!!!!!   :D
Of course it is needed, None can live in chaos and anarchy !We need a government, A Ruler !But another question ! Are current governments acceptable ?If you ask me, I say No, None of them are !

alright so, not a music rec but? i wasn't familiar with meg and dia until Just Now but. it says it's based steinbeck's east of eden. i haven't read that but we DID watch the film at the end of the year as well as the Cat On A Hot Tin Roof film (for a companion piece/to write about both) as a class in ap psychology (after testing was over, for extra credit). i'd recommend both films if u haven't seen them.
the lyrics for that meg and dia tune remind me of joy division's "i remember nothing" or new order's "all day long", like specifically the lyrics that hint at domestic abuse? also "he batters his tiny fist just to feel something" really stood out to me.
u should post yr finished work here too! i'd love to read it!
Hey thank you so much for your input. I haven't seen either of those films so i'll make to sure to check them out. and hopefully I'll get the guts to post it. Its my first time actually tryin to finish a book. So im pretty embarrassed/excited for it haha
Have you ever felt like, no matter what  anyone says, you can't be helped?

I'll be honest, I have depression, had it since I was a baby. I'm a freak and someone that is different. So I feel alone but I live through it
I am alone in several ways. I feel alone even when I'm around friends and other people. I know i'm not alone in that.There is no one quite like me. No one will ever truly understand me... such a cliche but because I, as a person am so far from being cliche, that it is a true statement. I don't even understand myself so how could anyone understand me fully. I feel disconected with others, like no matter what I do or say or no matter how I act, Im not the same. In a way I'm glad I'm not the same. I sometimes like being alone... unfortunatley people don't seem to understand that doesn't mean I don't care for their company. I can't stand the way people act in regard to their cell phones. They can't stand being alone and thinking for themselves, so they spend every minute connected to millions of other people who really don't care what they have to say. Anyway I don't know what to say anymore but back on topic; I am alone and sometimes I enjoy it. Other times the lonliness is nearly unbearable.
I feel like that all the time. Its honestly one of the worst feelings I could ever experience.
I am depressed almost everyday.It's like no one understands me.When I walk into school I have been judged on the way I dress since I wear black almost everyday and band shirts.I am shy because I have been through so much in my life.
I want to be emo and listen to them. But, Toni said they aren't emo. Is Toni Correct? Or is Fletcher and I correct? (btw, i'm single and ready to mingle!!!! HIT ME UP!) Answer first,tho. Toni eats my food sometimes and Fletcher, is gay, btw.

Here's Toni

P!ATD were NEVER an emo band. Most of the bands emo kids listen to are not emo. Real emo bands are Rites of Spring, Jimmy Eat World, Hawthorne Heights, Dashboard Confessional, etc.

Thanks! Toni is an ASS HAT XD
DALLON WEEKES IS HOT
How is this "toni" an asshat when they're correct?
OK,So if you saw my last forum post about "Is Panic! Still EMO?"(thank you btw for the answer). So even thought Toni is an ASS HAT, she still is pretty hot(I mean I wouldn't date her bc ew) but, she and Fletcher are dating. Idk what to do, btw he said to the entire school he was gay. I guess those feelings changed. Anyway what should I do bc like I said Toni is an ASS HAT
Update//- they were joking
Update//- they were joking
Update//- Fletcher just ate a hot dog
In my opinion, cheating is the worst thing in relationships. It should be dealt with by personal revenge. If you have clear evidence that someone cheated the person should be punished in a painful way. My methods are harsh since they consist of either castration or killing the cheater but they are suitable enough for people to convince them to not do it.
| My point of view: You just wasted many years on a person you loved when he/she lied to you and made love with another person without telling you before hand. What do you do? |
I'd "move along move along like ya know ya do!" All American Rejects taught me
I'd move on. It's happened to me before. Getting revenge on people who do that is childish. I'd just be the bigger person. Then keep them out of my life because the person isn't worth my time.
It's happened to everyone at some point in their lives. I've been cheated on many times unfortunately. And yes I've wanted to do serious harm to the guys who cheated. And I've gone through the various stages of 'grief' or whatever many times. And More than once almost gave up on finding anyone. But I finally found someone who doesn't just see me as a piece of meat and actually someone who actually cares about me and knows how to treat everyone no matter ther situation. And even treats women better than some women I know. 
But another thing I wanted to add was I have been the person who a guy was cheating with... I did not know that he had a girlfriend since I met him on a dating site. And I never met him but I did show him various things I would not have if I had known he already had someone. And I would have not been ok with him also sending me photos that should not be sent to someone other than your significant other. I told him to leave me alone as soon as I found out he had a girlfriend.
glad you did. :) Same here.
Hey I'm looking for a gf. I'm kinda lonely and I want a serious relationship. If any girls r interested please hmu

NO CHILL!!!
savage xD he is taking no prisners
I don't want a bf right now but I'll be your fwend? :3
I had this discussion with a friend - I have no idea but I'd love to hear your opinions
Part 1 : Free Will 
How much do you know about Parallel Universes & Higher Dimensions ?I Think it has something to do with that !
I Believe that there is one four dimensional reality which we live in. 3 Dimensional world or x, y & z, + fourth dimension which is time !
But this three dimensional universe needs to walk through fourth dimension, which means it moves between different timelines based on actions that happen by four dimensional creatures such as us or even Electrons and Protons !
Whatever happens the universe is walking through time and our decisions are painting this timeline as history as we walk on the line of time !
So we are not forced to live in a specific timeline, We can decide and our decisions make the timeline we live in !

Part 2 : Fate / Destiny 
The fact that we make the history doesn't mean dimensions higher than time depend on time, Because still these are higher dimensions defining the lines of time, So different histories and different lines of time are known to us, Yes even us, Humans !
We knows that If this happens then If that happens then we'll be moving on timeline named "x" else we will be moving on timeline named "y" ! We know the results of our decisions, We know the timelines !
But the fact that we know our fate does not mean that we have no free will to decide !

Part 3 : God 
For those who believe in a God who is the just & ultimate knower, There is a Question :
If I can decide my fate, Then God is not the Ultimate knower !If I can't decide my fate, Then God is Unjust !What is the answer to this Question ??
Actually, The question is wrong ! Yes there's no contradiction between Knowing the future and the fact of free will !
God is the ultimate knower so he knows what future has for us, He even knows what we decide, So he exactly knows which timeline human race chooses to walk on !But he just knows, Did he ever forced any man to decide something he / she doesn't want ?Never !So if he punishes a sinner, it won't be unjust !Yeah he knew that this guy is a sinner and he knew that this guy was going to do wrong, And he knew that this guy was going to be punished ! But this doesn't mean that he forced the guy to do anything !
He knew that guy's "Decision", which means he know what that guy "Decides" with his free will !Anything which is decided by freewill is Punishable or Rewardable !

Conclusion :
There is both Destiny and Free will, And if there is a God, He knows our fate and he gave us free will !There is no contradiction between knowledge of God and our free will cuz he just knows, He never forces us !

Personally, we'd rather sip some bear and let life be. We'd never know either way.

Out of curiosity has anyone done A level Philosophy? I'm currently studying it :)
I am truly interested in new idea and thoughts about how things work... I guess, how do you think things work? What is reality? What is our place in the universe and what is the universe? What makes us the way we are? Why do we feel emotion or the lack there of? What do you think? Tell me everything!
I have plenty of partial answers. Like the universe being everything in the ever expanding space. Or emotions being caused by the brain, the human brain, but other things can feel emotion, we just don't know what kind if emotion. Reality is life, and all it encompasses: EVERYTHING. I hope I cleared stuff up, or at least now you know what I think. GO PHILOSOPHY!
Universe - 1. A piece of someone's conciousness that we do not realise that we are in2. Simply a redirectory from a white whole that spitted out everything to a new dimension3. Creationsm of God (Can be actual God or metaphor)4. We're a part of a matrix simulation (Evidence is in radio cosmic radiation which in fact is on the same frequency as holograms)5. Everything is 'nothing'.
Yes, yes I have and it blows man. I have never cheated on someone nor plan to, i mean, why the fuck do something that you hate so badly to another? Yeah, delete that shit and move on, don't hold on to the past of a shitty moment; learn and move on. that is my opinion in the manner, the way you said it at the end sounded good as well.
That's cool dude. :). I never really deleted any of her photos or vids. Not that it matters, but it feels good to do it naturally. Like letting go in your mind, not physically. Makes you feel strong; that you managed in the face of the situation. c:. Whatever works best for you.
i agree strongly, some people really do have there own ways of handly things which at times well works actually better than otehrs. Also, totally get what you are saying dude.
how 'bout you man, how did you cope with it? do you still think of her? if you do which way?
I coup with it as so; I got a coupole of exs, I dealt with them all the same besides one on here who cheated on me harder than probably anyone elses ex on this site.
Do i still think of them, very much so and can never forget them which hurts badly at times, honesty it's very hard not to think of any of them. I mean, how does one truly forget someone that they truly love? to me you can't but you try badly to lie to yourself at times as if they were never in your life, but you know damn well the instant you see there face or something that you did together or whatever it all comes pouring in. You move on and get over it. it is a painful moment in your life, for some it is the worst and even kill themself from such a massive painful moment in there life. the way of think of them is like his, they cheated and lied hard as fuck to me, but i mean does that truly make them a bad person? That is how I think of most of them
The way for me is this; I like to believe that a lot of people lie for reasons, friends or family or just because they have no choice or some shit. I try my very damn hardest to try and not think ill will of those i cared for, still care deeply for a few of them but I mean I don't wanna get hurt again and some people never change and they will say whatever lie again or whatever to get what they want. so I wish them the best always anyways thou and I hope that they don't regret the horrible thing they had done. Maybe if lucky they learn from it? Maybe karma kicks in and they get what is coming to them; i don't know. I just try to move on, learn to trust again, give another a chance instead of giving up and shutting the world away, and try to be happy and wish everyone happiness, not suffering.

This has gone from cheating, cheated, English, killing, old Indian dudes who have heavenly english supposedly, and someone named Tommy Lynn Sells? I came here to say, that I had my heart torn out by some bitch. He killed every last shred of my heart. And I know, I know, being 13 doesn't count because you dont even know what love is, but I do. He was the love of my life. He might have just been the first love, but my love for him was no different. Sebastian. He is  the person that I couldn't go even a day without speaking to. If I did, I would have died because my entirety missed him. I would go absolutely crazy if he got sick and wasn't at school. I would stick to him. And its not like I was the only one who freaked out. If I was ever sick, he would be so sad. My friends say that after I moved, it was torture for him, and it still is for me. But I guess he had to just forget me and fill the void. With my best friend. I love him still. I miss him. And if you are sitting at home saying, thats not even love, then let me tell you this. Love, it changes your entire perspective. Everything around you is brighter, more alive. You want to be near them, touching them. You can just sit there in the middle of class and talk the entire time and no one would yell at you. They would look at you and smile and let you keep talking. When people see you hand in hand, they always smile. When you have your first kiss with them, both of your first kiss, an announcement would go off and you would laugh because they say that we had our first kiss and where. You would laugh at all the stupid things they said, all the stupid things you wish you said. When you wake up early and get ready for school, you would fuss about absolutely everything because you want to have the best day ever again. When you open your locker, you see notes and gifts. You would love the way when he was outside, you would see the light shining through his black short curly hair. His dark chocolate brown eyes surrounded by those long soft black lashes. His pale skin, still darker than mine. You look at him and you see his strong jaw line, his tall stature, his smile, oh his smile. When he smiles the world just melts around you. His hand in yours is truly a gift. He sees a puddle in the ground and picks me up like a baby and runs me over it. He gets soaked in mud and still doesn't care. He thinks he should clean up but it doesn't matter. You don't see a scrawny little teenage boy who loves playing sports, covered in mud. You see the boy who his eyes, his soul, glinting through him. The light doesn't seem to go around him, but through him. With him near, I wouldn't have been nearly raped by two boys in my new school, surrounded by fake people. I wouldn't worry about going back to school to  attacked by those boys because of me running away friday. I would have been alright. But, I am going back to school. With a broken heart form being cheated on by my love, and after being truly beaten down by some boys in a new state with no friends anymore. Just, me. With a broken heart, and bruises and cuts. And no one to hear me. All alone. That is the true heart break.
Canada by far is my most favorite country because of it's personal freedoms granted to us.
Sweden is a joke in terms of political ability and rationale. They let feminists run the country and the they grant immigrants a absurb amount of privilege and benefits for nothing. they even made it illegal to criticize government officials over the laws they write and the policies so yeah dont like the new laws? Dont say anything out loud as you can go to jail for speaking your mind.
I tend to stay out of politics. I recently had to take a policy course. Until then I had never really thought about it. My major concern with the US government is their tendency toward personally getting involved in peoples lives and the over abundance of governmetal bail outs and assistance.
I actually don't like Politics
Australia also has
 a bad prime minister -_-
USA has the largest prison population.
I don't like politics it just annoys me
im with the angel
Bernie Sanders for POTUS 2016 doe. The only trustworthy person in congress.
absolutly agree, Donald trump, Huckabee, all of those assholes are a major joke. and do not have our interests
politics is always going down the drain in my country, my current line of work is somewhat related to ask about it all the time so i get to hear a lot of people's opinions specially now in a year of candidates running for a position, i tend to take it only as my task to do whilst in the personal aspect i do not engage with the subject regularly
I personally think that this site has gone a little off coarse but I also think its because people are using it wrong. When I joined this site #1 I didn't think it ranked or judged people, which will make others feel bad and have possibly lower self esteem than they already have. (Mine is already in the negatives) #2 I thought this was a site for meeting people not being nosey and starting shit over worthless crap that most the time isn't about you.
well the admins aren't on as often so this site is having a few downfalls right now...
Which totally sucks :/ I don't blame the admin for being busy but I wouldn't trust today's modern society with a social networking site. They cant handle it, it gets unnecessarily messy.
i think i might leave, i'm tired of all this teenage drama i really am.
Awww nooo :'c Im tired of it too but I stay to prove im better. Plus I'd miss talking to you!
Well screw them. Who cares what they think? You and I know the truth, do we not? So why does it matter?
Eh, pretty soon all my friends will have deleted their accounts so... idk.. i'm REALLY fucking tired of dsirespectful kids whining about break ups or parents.
oh ok... well bye then..
k
Sorry you guys are feeling that way. No one should have to deal with anyone that makes us feel horrible. Admins are alway on this site at at least twice a day to resolve issues. If there are any members breaking our terms of service, feel free to report them and we will take care accordingly. However, I think most of the issues can be solved by members themeselves. You can unfriend, blocked. Those are two of the features that this site has and don't be afraid to use them. I have a member reported another member yesterday about abuse, but when i went and checked out the friendship status, they are still friends. I mean, it's not wrong to report abuse but dont be afraid to unfriend or block them to stop the issue from happening. With that being said. I'm closing this topic :-)
AHAHAHAHAHA fuck, who wants to play with some LoL kid that openly admits he's toxic AND buys accounts??? That's the exact opposite of what I wanna play with. I'd rather get cussed out by Russians in silver matches in CS GO.
Lol? Ew, go ride a bike or something. Seriously, if your parents molested you that badly vent out with a nice school shooting. League of Legends, Jesus. The only time I played that shitty ass game when I was helt captive by Jeffrey Dahmer and me playing it was the only thing from keeping a drill out of head.
AHAHAHAHA ^
The sarcasam is so obvious, Patrick.
Not sarcastic, i enjoyed ur comment. Also, may I point out, this kid says he can beat anyone in anygame because we're less than him...like...ok? Haha, if it's that tough for you to be confident in yourself that you have to inflate your ego by saying ur good at LoL, but yet you purchase accs, I think I already know I'm better than u. (((((((:

the actual story is really good tho.
cassettes said:
AS IF THERE IS ONE.
I'm a huge fan of FNAF, and have a ton of FNAF t-shirts xD. It really does have an awesome story line and the book he put out is really good too, I certainly hope he writes more.
There's a book? O.O
Yep! I think it's really good. It's called "Five Nights at Freddy's The Silver Eyes". I bought it online off of Barnes and Noble's website.
Maybe I should check it out the next time I order online... :)
Around summer time xD
It's definitely worth it! The story line isn't 100% like the games, so treat it as something almost completely new. It will seem kinda weird at first but it all comes together and makes sense if you just keep reading. I'm hoping he will turn it into a series!
Thank you for the recommendation! :D
DO YOU NOT SEE JUST HOW MUCH OF A CASH COW FNAF IS?
I'm a HUGE fan of Yugioh. (Even the spinoffs... Don't judge I know I'm crazy. XD) What's your fav kind of deck?

I love fighting g games in particular
I'm a huge fan of all the Silent Hill games. And the first few Resident Evil games.
he used his own youtube channel to attack his ex GF, that's kind of low. He's making fat shaming and really hateful comments about certain genre of people. I think he's an immature brat who is using his youtube channel to bully other. He's not offending people or talking about sensible topics, he's just being a narcissistic brat who tend to hurt people.
*quick note: I'm not taking any sides. I just want to know what people think.
People are getting butthurt because he's telling the truth lol
Some of his stuff, i feel, are aimed at what his fans would think to make sure they're on his side. Particularly his videos on Feminism. It's like he makes those videos purely to attract your average Tumblr feminist and he's awful with statistics and looking at context.
Trying to be edgy and funny
Tumblr-slay culture ;o
Yes Lory, he try to rally the average Tumblr teenagers girls on his side.
When you look at things he's one of the most hated youtubers and it's not because he's telling the truth, he's just an hypocrite with a really negative attitude who enjoy bashing on everyone who doesn't agree with him. Most of his video are just there to start drama and are filled with extreme douchery topic. He made multiple video just to humiliate his ex GF over internet. He made an entire fat shaming video, I think everyone agree that being obese isn't healthy. But, humiliating the fat kid in the schoolyard is just worse. When you keep throwing negativity around you like he does, it end coming back to you. Which is why he's highly hated.
I agree with Kikiroh.
he makes me laugh.
i never take most of his shit seriosuly ;3
I'm personally not a fan. I don't think he's a very good person and I'd even go as far as saying he's immature for the way he has handled some of his personal life affairs and the way he made them public when they didn't need to be that way?
I think he's an incredibly ignorant person.
The ex-girlfriend shaming videos were the last straw for me /.\
I can't believe that it's the ex girlfriend videos that count as the last straw for people._. My last straw was when he killed his turtle by being a fucking idiot. All subsequent events only reinforce my opinion of him.
He whaattt?? :O How?
Turtles 
He decided to put his turtle underneath a plastic tote in the middle of summer and suffocated it to death. He tried to take the heat off himself and say that the turtle died from stress thanks to his neighbours, but anyone with more than two brain cells should probably know that air holes for ventilation need to be put in any container to allow an animal to breathe. He cooked his turtle to death, slowly, and agonisingly.
The problem is that he has no tact. Even his opinions that I agree with, he finds the most horrendous and insulting way to execute it. Yay for freedom of speech and whatnot, but too many people see "free speech" and take it as "free to be a prick"
i find onison blunt yet, right on alot of subjects. i dont agree with everything. but he is funny.
Oh wow. He killed the turtle in a more brutal way than I would have guessed .
Onision being one of my all time favorite YouTubers, I have to say that sometimes he can be stupid as hell and counter himself in varying videos.
Some of his videos are funny. Other times he seems like hes just running his mouth and causeing unsessecary Drama between him and his multiple ex girlfriends. He has his faults. but overall Hes not a terrible person.
He's a pretty terrible person. I can agree that he can be funny, but he's very low on my list of people I respect. A good person wouldn't publicly humiliate people for fun, which he frequently does either about his real life relationships, or fellow youtubers.
Come to think of it. Perhaps your right.
In my mind, you can't say things to people that are directly meant to offend them or make them sad or feel miserable or even worse, then say it was just a joke it's a prank bro. No you can't if you do that you're a terrible person. He's making a living out of making some people feel miserable, that's not how a decent human being act at all.

None of which who he has targetted has given a single fuck. He's not making anyone sad, he's not making anyone miserable. He's literally just talking to himself when he makes videos the way he does. He's more open about expressing the way he feels. The things about his ex's? They've done shit worthy to be targetted. Oh, let me guess:"No one deserves to be targetted, no matter what they do."Bullshit. Anyone and everyone can be targetted with something they've done in the past. The way they handle it is what matters. Look at LeafyIsHere. He can be a funny guy, but he targets people that are cringey. In no way does he want them to jump off a bridge or kill themselves or some shit. There was already an incident where he didn't do enough research and ended up targetting an autistic man. Some people grow to popularity in this way and it doesn't harm a single bean.D'aw, wook. Poodiepaw is getting bashed on by Dillon The Hacker.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_UCHv47uALik if u cri evrtim.ANYONE and I mean ANYONE who becomes popular in media are going to get bashed on. As I've said before, it depends on the way they handle it. Some bitch ass kid came on my Twitch a couple weeks ago and told me I shouldn't stream because I'm a kid (15 atm). I could've slit my wrists and hung off a noose, but I didn't. You want to know why? Because I'm not a damn baby and know that I'm better than that shit. Do you think I'm making fun of people who self harm and kill themselves? Well, I'm not. I literally just demonstrated a real life situation that could've happened.Either way, Onision is doing nothing wrong. He is stupid sometimes but overall is one of my favorite YouTubers. I don't agree with everything he says, but either way, he's a god damn fine person.EDIT: For those of you guys getting all triggered from videos like his cutting videos and whatever, don't like it? Don't fucking watch it. Simple as that. If you do watch it, that's your own fault.

I think he is a terrible excuse for a human being, he has no moral value or standard. he's a narcissic person who only care about himself, and enjoy hurting other.

I dunno, killing an animal out of neglect and stupidity and not taking responsibility for his actions while claiming to be an animal rights activist certainly doesn't show off a heart of gold.

I started Death Note a week ago and have been watching a few episodes every day. I thought it was fucking amazing until I got to episode 18 today...it's all over the place and confusing especially this new plot twist about the corporation killing off businessmen. I love L too much to give it up, I'm gonna finish the series but I hope it gets back on track within the next few episodes (no spoilers please).

Says you.
Watch 2 animes and then come back and say they have the same plot. The only way anyone would be saying they're "all the same" is if they've never. Watched. Any.
And yeah, this is a 3edgy5me situation. A middle school kid who's too sophisticated for an aspect of pop culture and feels the need to share their salty opinion on it.

I've tried to watch AoT and Death Note. They were both boring and samey. And don't even get me started on the actual animation.
Ooooh you must be SUCH an expert on animation.
I have you blocked, you aren't supposed to be able to see anything I post. Did you find a way to override that or something?
I don't need to have a degree in music production to say that Justin Beiber's "Baby" is shit. The same logic should supply here.
That song is shit. That, however, is opinion. People who like his music just have different music tastes. Your opinions aren't fact. Life is a hell of a lot more enjoyable if you let people like the things they like.
I like pointing out the flaws in things. So stop being a hypocrite~
Show me where I was a hypocrite.
"Life is a hell of a lot more enjoyable if you let people like the things they like."
In this sentence, you're practically telling me not to do this stuff. But you are also telling me not to do something I enjoy.
Pointing out the flaws in things is such a pessimistic thing to "enjoy".
By the way, no, I'm still blocked from seeing your profile. Not posts.
It is. But I enjoy it.
I haven't even finished Deathnote -.- my parents gave my sister my phone so I couldn't watch it and plus I've been busy lately
Good, you didn't become a weeaboo.
Lol

Sure, keep deluding yourself.
You make no sense whatsoever. You're 13, quit acting like you know everything. You're not the authority on the definition of a weeaboo.

You seem to have this thing with me being 13. Age has nothing to do with the subject at hand. And you aren't the authority either.

I've seen some episodes of One Piece on Adult Swim but I never got the chance to watch it
It is epic! You can watch it on Hulu.
Oh my lord you're a life saver I didn't even think of that I just use Netflix for the majority of my shows and then kissanime
It's also on Crunchyroll
Awe I don't use crunchyroll hehe my ipod isn't exactly the newest
crunchyroll isn't just an app it's a website too
O! Thanks
But on Crunchyroll it has you pay for certain episodes. Use Hulu, CR isn't worth the hassle (I know Hulu is paid but still)
Hulu not hulu plus right? Because I heard that Hulu plus is where you pay and hulu is free
Yeah.
SomeOne watched AnoHana the flower we saw that day
I really love that short series.
I've seen many anime and read many manga but the bests are:
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Berserk
Mirai Nikki
Black Butler
but jojo is the best :D
I grew up on Dragon Ball Z,
Sailor Moon, Card Captors, Gundam, and Cyborg009,
I didn't see those listed so I'm guessing I'm the only one that maybe liked them?...
Also liked and currently watching Fairy Tail...

I've watched all the anime listed by everyone above,
and by this I'm sure you can guess that I'm more of an anime than manga...
I'm just not a reader...
I love Fairy Tail my number one favorite.
-_- These are my kind of people don't disrespect my kind of people or face The Wrath Of My Tormented soul......
Has nobody said Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, One Punch Man, Mushi-shi, Chrono's Crusade, or Parasyte yet??? What the hell? These are some of the best television shows I've ever seen.
One Punch Man is 1000000% worth the hype. It's fucking hilarious!
Also, watch the movies Akira and Grace of the Fireflies.

I prefer Osu then Audiosurf 2. What do u think? Haha but I have Steam too! wanna play something? c(x I'm bored af.
I've only played Osu once or twice, but I quite like it cx I love multiplayer games too, but sadly my graphics card and internet are both too shit to play most of the games that I'm usually into. If you wanna add me, we can compare game libraries and figure out what we CAN play once I get a more solid connection and rebuild my computer :D
You said you're in Germany on your profile, yes? I'd have to switch to the European servers to play with you since I'm on the North American ones, but I'm a level 30 c: I play a bit of everything, but I main ADC and Mid
Darn.. I don't have Audiosurf.. I have Vindictus, Zombies Monsters Robots (ZMR), War Thunder, Nosgoth, No More Room In Hell, and Blacklight Retribution. Those are the only free games I have on Steam -
I love Vindictus!
Yo steam as hell ya AnarchWolfe if hat doesn't work AnarchWulfe
Love that game.
Bishhhhh Jack Falahee omg, did you just here my panies drop!
yasss boooh yaaasss
I only made it to season 2
I really like horro movies, I've heard of this series but never tried, is this good?
All horror movies are now remakes of something else. There is no originality and i can pretty much tell what the ending will be. Dissapointing... But i kinda am interested in more real life horror shows than fantacy movies that take the piss. When its based on real life it makes it so much more relevant.
if you look carefully you can find some very interesting gems in horror movies that are very unique
Do you have any recommedations?
Thanks, I'll check them out
I finished the Coven season last week!
I really enjoyed that season especially the cast. I reckon it could have been darker though...

Horror, Action, Comedy, Drama, Documentary, Sci-Fi? What is your favorite film genre?
I ABSOLUTELY love horror, blood, gore and all that. But I can enjoy a good comedy from time to time
Horror, but I can go with those cheesy children's animated films as well. Also, some "inappropriate comedy" movies.                      

              This post was edited by xiSteinxx at November 1, 2015 9:01 PM EST
Horrow, Thriller, Drama, Mystery, and Adventure c:
Comedy, romantic comedy, and mainly horror ^.^
My favorite movie genre would have to be horror
Psychological thrillers probably take the cake for my #1 film genre, I love a good plot twist. I also heavily appreciate Horror and Sci-fi films though.
Ugh, Gothic movies, the kind with some messed up romance and some kind of mystery involved. If not, something sinister and intriguing, but not too slow. I loved the movie Red Rover but I honestly can't find it anymore lol
Psychological Thrillers are pretty cool. Anything with some mindscrew to it is cool, anything like... Eraserhead.
Oh, also, Threads is a good movie.
to quote yahtzee and his zero punctuation episode of the evil within "horror horror and horror"
HOWLS MOVING CASTLE 
Sci-Fi
But I like a good comedy every now & then, they're easy to watch
Anyone out there on the vita?  If so anyone's free to hit me up for a game or just to chat my username is CuteDaemon (though I don't have very many games yet).

haha, don't get me started... oh, too late :P
How about bleach? I mean half the episodes are fillers!
That's so right lol
Attack on Titan, bleach, naruto... even death note kinda. all the shit ones all the frilly weeaboos latch onto.
I started Attack on Titan last week and it's actually pretty intense. You should watch it before judging it. It's popular for a reason.
THEY'RE ALL OVERRATED
Why don't you explain how that's a fact and not just your opinion lol sorry but your tastes probably aren't as sophisticated as you think

Not saying I'm unique. I'm just saying, I'm not one for pop or anime. Not saying I'm SPECIAL for that or anything.
SERIOUSLY, YOU'S DO WELL IN THE PRESS. YOU DO ONE HELL OF A GOOD JOB AT MISREPRESENTING PEOPLE AND SUCH.
Come to think of it, as we're on the topic of age and such, is the really any point in criticizing a 14 year-old on trying to appear special or different?
fucking hell this is still happening?

not even talking about overrated anime anymore... ffs...

Metal Gear Solid

Mines jimmy4syn but Im quite random with gameplay
So I am extremely excited (and unless you are a 3DS gamer you may not have any idea what I am talking about...but ) I will be receiving the new N3DS flash-cart Tuesday!!! It is the SKY3DS+ It is compatible with all updates and new N3DS Roms!!! It also supports emulators! This means that it will continue to be used for future releases!
If anyone is interested PM me and I can provide links for the flash-cart as well as roms!

Cloud Atlas.
This topic is if anyone wants to meet up in UK and maybe start a YouTube channel,about blogging and gaming and having fun,so on
Do people still play trading card games? I see them everywhere but never seen anyone with them. If anyone still plays what do you play?
I play YuGiOh xD
same here ^^^
With the new cards? All I have is the old stuff like dark magician and blue eyes white Dragon.
i play both old and new my main deck is a blue eyes one
How much of a difference is there between the two? I wanted to try the new stuff but I heard there was a bunch of new rules.
a lot but a couple games with someone who knows what there doing and your set its not that bad but i still prefer the old one
I played competative YGO for a while, I been most uprising since Dragon Ruler format, going all out and spending a fortune on a deck. My friend and I own a channel for it especially, it's called UtoshiDawnagonii, and we did a real life series before. The game has a strong connection with his past life, so it means a lot to him, and purely I do it for the fun and hanging out. Other tcg games I play are MTG and Pokemon, with MTG I use R/G monsters, and Pokemon I used this Darkrai/Darkrai EX and Absol kinda deck.
Oh and @Daemon you probably were around when synchros came out. Well now, they have a new game mechanic called XYZ, which is taking 2 lvl 4 monsters for example, puting one on top of the other, and then throwing down an XYZ monster (rank 4) over those.Now there is a new term in YGO called excavate which is just milling I believe. (Top card to the graveyard)Finally, the most recent thing I heard was of Pendulum summoning, which is complex, I don't understand it, but there is a deck dedicated to it called Qlips, and they are tier atm. The new tier stuff is Satellars and Nekroz.
ALSO the most recent update that happened with the game, is a new banlist came out just recently, and Trishula has came back to 1, that is the most significant change on the list imo.
I play competitive right now. I have a Qliphort deck and a Shaddoll deck. The current top tier 1 decks I think right now in the current format is Nekroz, Burning Abyss (TCG onky deck), Satellars, Shaddolls, and Qliphorts. Pendulum summoning is kind of easy.  First of all of course you need Pendulum monsters which can be monsters or spells. Some have monster effects or pendulum effects. You can pendulum summon by activating pendulum cards in the pendulum zone. Basically right now they act as spells not monsters. You can pendulum summon monsters in between the scales. The scales are just the numbers by the blue and read arrow. So if you have a scale of 9 and the other is 3, you can pendulum summon ,once per turn, any monsters that are levels 8-4 as long as they can be special summoned. What I mean by this is you still can't special summon certain cards that can only be special summoned a certain way like Chaos Sorcerer. Also pendulum summons are inherent which basically means their summoning doesn't create a chain. In Qliphorts, you can only special summon "Qli" monsters because of the pendulum scales. Also, pendulum monsters do not go to the graveyard when they are destroyed, sent, or tributed. Insteady they go face-up on the extra deck. Pendulum monsters do not go to the extra deck if you return them to the deck or hand or if you banish them. Also, you can special summon as many monsters as you want from your hand or face-up in the extra deck. Hope this kind of helped xD
im not even going to pretend i tried to read that my dyslexia kicked in before the third line
I started playing with the Kiba starter deck before he had blue eyes ultimate so all of this talk of synchro and xyz things are foreign to me. I do have a bunch of Pokemon cards but the newest ones are from when mudkip was a starter. I am collecting and playing magic the gathering though so I actually have some new cards for that.
I wish they didn't ban the rulers, I had fun trying to make Lightsworns competative, as did my friend on the channel. My friend is way better at the game than me, but I had my fair runs and funs on the game. Currently I am playing for the fun of it, and to rebuild the series :p .
MTG was bs when it came to me and my friends. I had a shitty Modern Angel deck, and I lost and played anyways. The moment I got a beasty dirty R/G monster deck, I beat everyone in ease, and everyone quit, so I quit because nobody wanted to play.
i have a kaiba character deck that was hellish hard to make haha
I had the one from the box hahaha
i got a couple of them when i got back into the game
Maybe I'll go pick a new box up and see if I like it. Any recommendations?
The meta is janky and if you want to be competative, be ready to spend a shit ton out of your pocket.I would advise playing what you like xD
Well I thought I'd pick up a starter deck to ease back into it.
And it'd just be for fun.
I'd say go with something you like, or something you wanna try. When it comes to competative play, I would play Satellars because they are spammy and I know how to play them. For fun, I do lightsworns, Madolche (anjelly combo OP) ;D , and the first deck I bought myself, Six Samurais. I have played the old Yugi and Kaiba starter decks back in the days, but I literally didn't play by the rules.
What do you guys think about?

I was not aa fan of the first season does it get any better or am I looking at the same stuff.
I'll do my best to refrain from spoiling anyone. I would like to see them kill off Daryl. I use to be a huge fan girl of his but, really, though, with what's coming up, I wouldn't mind if he were to go in place of someone else. @Nickasaur, you should really catch up though! Where they're at, the most will be happening. I'm looking forward to season 6 
I had never seen it until recently. A friend of ours is a die hard fan, she made us all buy tickets to the Walking Dead convention here and made us all sit down and watch season 1 beforehand in 1 sitting lol. So now I'm finally familiar with it. We bought her a walking dead video g game to plug in her TV for her bday and a walking dead hat.
I'm a few seasons behind so I'm not sure what's going on. I basically know who is still alive and who dies. It kinda ruined it for me.
Dont worry its much better once you see it for yourself. Its really good and awesome
I want something signed xD
I used to go to my friends' house and we'd have a Walking Dead party every sunday when it aired with, like 8 or more people. I got everyone to post on facebook about Darryl dying.

We all got a ton of hate messages from friends about how we should kill ourselves for spoiling it and shit and everyone was pissed. We even made the people who saw the episode think they watched the rerun.

So two weeks later, I was at a friend's birthday dinner and this one dude sitting next to me was talking to his girlfriend and said "I totally gave up on watching the Walking Dead a month ago because I heard Darryl died so it doesn't matter anymore."

I giggled.
I love The Walking Dead

I've used manic panic before, but used only one of their colors which was Vampire Red. I think it's really easy to use, but its fades quick.
Ok, and you just put it on, not mix it with peroxide?
No, don't mix with peroxide. It says it on the bottle/Jar too
Thanks! I recently got it dyed and the purple they used faded pretty quick after only two washes. And they did bleach my hair. It wasn't as light as I wanted it to be since I've had COLOR on top of color on top of color since none of the colors of done required bleaching since I couldn't have any 'crazy hair Colton' where I worked. But then when I started my new job in August and they said it was allowed. But I started with only a little 'crazy' color at first. And then went all out just recently. 
So when they bleaches my hair they had to do it twice to get it to be light enough for the purple to show. But still could've been lighter. 
So I'm thinking of buying just some purple and putting it in every once in a while. And maybe the blue that is underneath as well just to touch it up every once in a while instead of paying to get it done every few weeks since I'm not working anymore to focus on school.
I've been dyeing my hair since I was 7 (20 now xD)
I have always jumped back and forth between getting my hair done at a Salon or DIM with Manic Panic.
I recently switched to Splat when I learned a friend of mine never gets her done professionally and uses that product.
It comes with bleaching, the hair color and a comb. Though bleaching ones hair numerous times does do massive damage on ones hair.
Last year I got a chemical hair cut bleaching one to many and had to cut my hair boyish shoirt and let it grow out.
I live in Canada though and Splat/Manic Panic are the same price. If I'm not bleaching my hair. I'll go MP. If I am and I'm being careful/having someone do it for me. I'll go Splat.
I enjoyed it. I did the Red/Purple Splat. The red stayed for about one month even with my exessive washing every other day.
The purple faded extremely quick like within a week which I found unfortunately. I loved the vibrance 
Manic panic never worked for me. I have black hair so I needed a good bleach kit, (~$45) and then colour. Id bleach, wait a few days and colour, and a week later it was faded. I've tried green, blue, pink, red, and purple,before seeking another brand. 
I switched to Splat, which comes with bleach (for ~$15) and I had the colour stay vivid up to 3-4 months, (crimson red). 
Maybe MP wasn't compatible with me because I know others that it worked fine for others. 

One tip I can suggest for longer colour wear is to add a drop, maybe the size of a dimensional, to your shampoo. It refreshes the colour. Only downside about Splat, (not sure about MP) is the staining.
This is awesome but is the website reliable I mean it's not like a scam site or nothing rightand is the shipping reasonable? 
If so I might buy from them in the near future. :3
yeah it's more reliable that those wholesale site. just be warned the shipping might be a bit much.. but it is still reliable.
Thanks thats good to know and if the shipping is'ent to much I'll probably be shopping from them pretty soon. :3
Oh god I've been looking for something like this for so long! It's hard to find any pastel goth clothing in normal stores, and even then it's not usually what I'm looking for. Good resources are so rare ;n; thank you for this gift
No problem!!! D: i know the struggle. it's so frickin hard .
I've never heard of the terms pastel goth. lol. I'm getting old. But anyways, thats some cute stuff.
Hello! I'm Savannah! c: I am 14. Anyway, I also ask my mom, "Mom, if I pay for the makeup, can I start wearing black eyeshadow/eyeliner?" and my mom always says "No. I don't want you to be Goth." I never tell her that there are different styles. My grandparents think I'm becoming Goth just because I have teal in my hair. Can someone tell me if I'm too young to wear black eyeshadow/eyeliner? Or should I give my mom more time to think about the question? All comments will be appreciated!
It's hard to say if you're too 'young' to be wearing makeup as I believe everyone does things at their own pace, however.. here's an idea :)Maybe you can sit down and talk to your mom about makeup more. Quite possibly if you ask her to teach you different ways to apply the eyeshadow/eyeliner so it won't look too heavy or like too much to start off with, maybe she'll be more open to it :)
You're very welcome! I've been told that many times haha :)Well, a bit like the makeup thing, you may need to just sit and talk with her about it. Explain that since your hair is already partially teal, you'd really like to dye the rest of it. Maybe even go as far to explain how happy it'd make you to do so. Worst case scenerio, you could always dye your hair back to a more natural color so it shouldn't be too big of a deal :)
Thank you for helping me! :) Anyway, my grandparents think I'm Goth just because I got teal highlights about 4 months ago (which my mom let me have...) I don't mean to be rude...but how did you get your parents/guardian to let you dye your hair? I haven't talked to my mom about the makeup yet..but I'm going to wait until she's in a good mood. Anyway, uhm....my mom won't let me date...I mean..it's not like I am going to get pregnant or something...but..anyway...yeah. c: Wow...this has turned into a not-about-hair anymore topic! Haha... :) I hope you don't mind that I'm asking all these questions..and if you do..I'm so sorry and I won't bother you again.
You're welcome :) I don't mind you asking questions, I'm here to help!Well see.. I'm an adult, 20 and live on my own, I've lived on my own since I was 16.. so my mom has zero say in anything I do, nor does she even care xD so I was always able to do whatever I wanted, however.. being you are 14 & live under your mother's rules the best thing to do is just be respectful about the sitatuion and just explain all the reasons why you really want to do those things:) Sometimes parents automatically think the worst when it comes to things, so it's best to just talk it out & express the happiness it'll bring you..and just hope they understand :)
I gradually did it. I would go darker and darker each week and my mom finally just accepted it. I love makeup, and always have. And now I work as an independent presenter for a makeup company and sell makeup everyday! It is your face. Experiment and find what looks you like and perfect them, then those around you will accept and love your style because it's yours! 
I did the same thing as Shannon did. I just let it get darker and darker.
Although my profile picture isn't a good example, I'm not wearing make up in that one cx
Well if you're living with your parents, you can't do much other than sit down and talk to them calmly. My mom didn't like me wearing dark makeup, but after a while she agreed to let me wear it on weekends. As soon as I moved out, it was black eyeliner and bright red eye shadow every day.
I haven't gotten an emo haircut (layered with side bangs) since I was 13 and I wasn't even emo back then I just liked how it looked, and I really want to get another one this summer but I haven't found good reference images online. I'm growing my hair out and I want to get an emo style without decreasing the length. Any ideas?
Get dreads! ^_^
erm, I'm white, so that would be cultural apropriation.
I have dreads.... I'm white....
Lol I'm not sure what style I want out what color(s) so plz give suggestions.

I share the same opinion as the tiny one.
Makeup isn't for feeling confident, it's foor looking cool. Thick black eyeliner looks metal as fuck.

You just made my point further.
If you care that you look cool or how you look, then you might LACK CONFIDENCE in yourself of how you feel. 

              This post was edited by TinyRick at July 9, 2016 4:12 PM EDT
You don't get my point. There are people who are very confident but still wear makeup, for example pink lipgloss, because they love the color pink. Plus, putting on makeup is fucking fun. I like my bare face, I don't wear makeup on a daily basis but I wear black eyeliner to concerts because it looks badass, and sometimes it's fun to just put on a bunch of makeup and look like a barbie.
Plus have you thought of people who wear it for their job? Like drag queens?
SteFno said:

Makeup Artists are also required to wear it when they work.Who's going to get their makeup done by someone who isn't wearing any?Even us Freelancers have to wear it to get jobsPlus, makeup is makeup.I like being able to change who I am when I feel like itSometimes, I'm me and that's greatOther times, I put it on and I'm more laid back and relaxed.And then, if I want to be gay AF and wear everything pink and act like Barbie.. Well, I can.

Hi guys ^^
Two days ago i lost my emo hair((((((
I hang out on party and some assh*les shaved me bald((
So i got a question, how i can look in emo style without emo hair?
Maybe i need some ballcap or hat?
Thanks)
Wow, those are a bunch of assh*les! I'm so sorry they did that! I'm not good with hair and stuff, so I sadly won't be much help, but, you could always wear a beanie or something, I guess. Sorry, I' m not good at this.

Oh and also you can go to the police to report this...In the US it's assault and battery.

That's what you get for looking gay in Russia xD
^his profile says he lives in Arizona, which I hope is true cause all gay and/or alternative russians should consider immigration
Beanies are helpful for covering a head. Some cosplay/costume locations have beanies with sewn on black hair sticking out for decoration.
Up until the past six months or so, I'd been using Manic Panic for all my dyeing needs. The problem with living in British Columbia (Canada) is that Manic Panic isn't the most available on the market. You can find it, it's just not nearly as common in drug stores or alternative shops. My replacement to remedy this dilemma was to switch over to Punky Colour. I do like the way it takes to my hair, and it lasts roughly the same amount of time (maybe even a bit longer) than Manic Panic. My only slight problem with it is that it isn't completely vegan. I felt a bit better knowing I was supporting a brand adamantly against animal testing and chemical use in products.What are your go-to dyes for rainbow colours? Preferably ones that can be taken off the shelf, not a salon brand/one that must be ordered.
i used splat when i dyed my hair. it worked way better than manic panic for me. manic panic didn't last as long in my hair as splat did.
Same! I've used Splat and it's pretty good, but I reccomend you can go get it done by a proffesional instead.
If you're worried about it being tested on animals, ask them! Probably not anyway ^.^
Try the ION dye. the aquamarine is amazing. i never had much luck with the pink.
N Rage also has really really good dye. [:
i use the manic panic hair dye, crazy colours even ones that glow under UV light (black light) they are very pigmented and easy to use :)
I usually use splat. (The purple in my profile pic is splat)
Arctic fox is really good it like manic panic but I lwrsytbi k it's better and also it is vegan and not tested on animals

If you want fashion then go to the store, go shooping and buy some clothes or some accessories and then paid for them and you will haveeither EMO clothes or EMO accessories.
Or just look up stores online
Well nobody is perfect just to let you know XD ;)
My accessories I used to have about 10 pireceings  I had one on my nose still do 4 on my lips 2 each side  I only have 2 now and 4 on my eye brows 2 on each side go with what I did it takes time for the skin to grow back YA...

hey everyone,i was wondering how you guys spike your hair(preferably using gel or something like it) i dont have access to the pressy thingy(can't remember the name off the top of my head) so i would like something i can do with gel or other hair product. thanks guys and girls :)
Um there are good gel products. I use my dads XD what you do is you get a little bit and rub it onto your hands a bit. I get sections of my hair, hold it between my hands with the gel on them and quickly and messily rub my hair between my hands. Not up and down, sideways, like you're rolling something. Sorry I'm not good at explaining :( just try it and see if it helps. I hope it does~
My hair is stubborn so I use hair glue, especially when I had my Mohawk. What I do is put some in my palms and then rub it together enough just to spread it out. Then make sure you get close to the root of the hair and pull the hair into water direction you want it. Support the bottom more than the top, or its more likely to just fall over limp. Hairspray if you need the need.
ok so im updating my wardrobe and its basically just a bunch of super old emo/scene clothes from the early 2000s like hottopic n shit so if u have any ud like to sell in a bundle or give away (id pay shipping!) message me on here and send me pics of the stuff ahhh ! also goth/cyber/raver stuff is super cool too! n if u have like any gloomy bear or invader zim stuff i might buy that from u thanx a lot!! 
My hair is a bit short, I'm growing out my pixie. I already have sweeping bangs, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a style i could grow my hair into and color ideas for dyeing it? Something that would be good for my face and skin tone? Any ideas are appreciated Xp Xp

Shave the whole thing
DylanDylan said:
Shave the whole thing
shaved hair is such a good underrated emo look, so is short hair
example


i think there's been a trend towards more expressive, longer, colorful, modified hair and makeup since the mid 2000s which is cool but i think that's sort of at the point where it's reversing. i dyed my hair in elementary and middle school when i was last really active in emo circles, and the younger emo kids at my high school tend to have dyed hair. but i never deliberately styled mine or did multicolors, extensions, clips etc. (little energy), and i don't see these kids doing that either. i've had natural hair for a while now, and i'm even considering getting some sort of Dykey-Butchy shortcut because i think that'll compliment my face better
^Personally, I think a cut like this looks great on almost anyone.
Such a familiar problem! I'm also very confused while thinking about changing my hairstyle :) at this time I have a great experience in this and can't stand from sharing with you guys some creative ideas even if this topic started long time time ago, suppose that this info will be useful for all forum members :)
Usually I search for interesting ideas on different sites for example last time I used a good article with beautiful photos I chose "blue pixie" the only difference is that my hair is much longer :)

Yeah, I hear ya, it was mainly a phase for me, because I always had my long hair, now it's semi-short, I guess that medium length hair kinda style. I'll grow out the hair again, just not the eyeliner-phase again. :p
ha, do you bro. stay up and stay emo !!!
Haha ;D word bruh c:
Makeup is awesome on guys, but be careful on how you put it on :P
Hahaha :)
Make up on guys is amazing! I think it's hot personally, and a lot of others have the same opinion. Coming from a girl, guys should wear make up if they want to even though society may think lowly of it.
Yeah cx agreed, I mean I would, but I don't think I suit it anymore cx
completely support. but what about finger nail polish?
Nail polish is awesome too :) I'm a big fan of makeup :P
There is a forum post just on that I saw xD good look with the discussion!I use to do that via grade 9, fingerless gloves and made sure they were black fingernails :3
thanks bruh :)
I agree it doesn't matter what other people think if you like it go for it
I personally think eyeliner on guys is hot :3
Only a small percent of guys can pull it off. Personally, I dont particually like it. Except for special occasions. (like a show or concert or such)
I wear eyeliner sometimes not always and get lots of compliments but my parents hate when I do cx
I say do whatever makes you you and makes you happy ^u^Fuck the haters.
I think its adorable when guys actually do what they want with themselves, and not care what others think (so eyeliner counts!)
Guys that wear makeup? I think if they want to wear makeup then let them.... I aceept them... theres nothing wrong with a guy to wear makeup if they want
I definetly LOVE guys who wear eyeliner! *U*
i think its cute but its up to them because i personally think the sexyest thing a guy can do is be them selves and treat others with respect
I think makeup AND nail polish should be accepted on guys in the society as it is girls. It isn't 'gay' for a guy to wear makeup, have his ears pierced or have his nails painted AT ALL. (No offence to gays, I support them). I personally think guys look quite cool with their nails painted, eyeliner and both ears pierced. There is nothing wrong with it and any guy that likes makeup and nail polish has my full respect.

I think it looks great on most emo guys who r cute..
i think eyeliner on guys looks amazing :)
I think that eyeliner on some guys is really hot and sometimes it looks really bad but I have no problem with a guy if he wears it. It depends on how much you use and wear you use it (top or bottom of the eye) But I'm in a committed relationship with eyeliner and no one else can have my baby
I think guys that wear alot of eyeliner are cool, they are abble to share their style even though others might judge you. I call eyeliner on guys "Guyliner" Lol
I love it as long as they apply it correctly.
honestly love seeing dudes in all kinds of makeup
honestly hate seeing dudes
at all.
I love eyeliner and black nail polish on guys :')
i was just playin
idk i just distrust men and look down on dudes
boys can be cute and femme boys, sensitive boys are important and we should protect them if they express those sides of themselves
Do iiiit
I'll watch I'm still learning how to do make up I like yours
i need some ideas for looks to go for :o
Thanks :) yeah, i'd post a pic to help with the hair but i'm having technical difficulties so XP and yeah that helps a lot.
I love the 1 one
I love the first one the best
Okay maybe I will do the first one next month =)
cool I would like to see a pic after its done
Me too but It will take a while for me to get my new tablet beause it will cost more money than a hair dye but I'm tryinfg my very best to save up all my money and I will soon or later upload a photo of myself but it will maybe take months though
its ok
its ok
As probably noted from my profile picture, I have blond in my hair. I'm thinking of putting another color in my hair. WHich color should I put in it? I'm open to all colors and as well as the brands.
A dark blue or red would look good, ig...
Hmm... I guess I will try red. Do one of you two know how much it would cost?
@sk8ordie754 Nope, sorry... My mom won't let me dye my hair until I'm 18. It's SO stupid.
Here in Canada its like 15$
@sk8ordie754 With my mom, there's no way to convince her to do anything unless you're more stubborn than her. I win some, I lose some.
Just fight for it then haha @dary105
Red. Red. Red. I always suggest getting your own developer and dye that they use in the salons. Its much better quality then the stuff in the box. With red you should have to strip the color out of your hair first though.

Opeth - one of the greatest metal bands of all time and easily the best band of our (1990 and onward) generation.
Drop Dead, Gorgeous - purely due to the nostalgia :p
Black veil brides
Sonata Arctica - The most beautiful lyrics I've heard in my life which also help you with a broken heart ^ ^
Leathermouth probably. :)
You guys all have amazing music!! Wonderful music taste!!
My chemical romance!  -They are amazing!!!
My favorite band is Motionless in White because their songs never get old, Chris does great vocals, the instrumentals are amazing, their songs are really catchy, and they play amazingly well live. I'm actually going to see them on Sunday when they play with The Devil Wears Prada, The Word Alive, Upon a Burning Body, and The Color Morale.
XxRebelAngelxX COOL!I also love em!And I totally agree about MIW's songs
One of my fave songs by them is" A.M.E.R.I.CA ",I dont know why but I love this song and  "Devil in the Mirror" mostly cause its the of their songs I heard
"Devil in the Mirror" cause it was the first song I heard by them
Oh that's cool ^.^ I can't choose a favorite when it comes to Motionless in White, but when it comes to Black Veil Brides, my favorite would have to be "I Am Bulletproof"
That's,same to me for BVB
I meant to say thats cool
Three Days Grace! :3
black veil brides ,live like a galass, avion roe'silverstain,snow white's poison bite and bring me the orizont
Pierce the Veil is one of my favorites
Ph thats so cool @kirashfflemo and @Aluetalovesbands
Slipknot or Five Finger Death Punch tbh :P

- Courage my Love
Well I don't know much about the Story. But I like them when they played with David Blade-Dickson. That's nice I wish I were there too. But I actually live in Germany. So it wasn't possible 4 me to travel over there haha
Black Veil Brides or My Chemical Romance
Pierce the Veil 
Asking Alexandria
Miss May I
Troubled Coast - Super catchy instrumentals that put a lot of feeling into the songs. All the guys in the band have superb chemistry and never play over one another. The lyrics are incredible, could honestly stand alone as poetry, and the way they're sung is always perfect. No other band can switch so seamlessly between screaming, singing, and spoken vocals.

Honorable mentions- La Dispute, Periphery, Silverstein, Saetia, and Lead Hands.
5. Black Veil Brides
4. Palaye Royale
3. Escape the Fate
2. Icon for Hire
1. Get Scared
My first favorite band is RHCP, so they'll always hold a special place in my heart, but following a line of thinking more relevant to the rest of you, AFI, Apocalyptica, Jeffree Star, Creed, Three Days Grace, and Rancid are also favorites of mine.
Probably motionless in white, chelsea grin, or thy art is murder
My Chemical Romance are my favorite band for a reason that is very dear to me. No they did not "save" my life like so many kids claim their favorite band did but they changed my life. I discovered them in january of last year when I was a junior. The entirety of that school year was hell for me, I was tired and very stressed 24/7. MCR made me get into music I never knew I would enjoy and all that music was a bright spot during the worst school year of my life. I may have discovered them after they broke up but they were my main source of happiness last year and I'm grateful.

Twenty One Pilots.
Where my clique at?
^right here bro
BMTH, Pierce the Vil, Green Day, some russian emo groups like Dozavtra, Jane Air, Evo and my very favorite band is Nirvana
Follow My Lead = my ALL TIME favourite! Their songs are so relatible, and have that heavy rhythm I love! I recommend listening to "Jugular"
BORING
They're not your type of music therefore they are boring. Seems legit. We think bands you like are boring, doesn't mean they universally are. Paradox.
Well, no. Your bands are boring, it's fact.
That's not how music works my dude.
No, you're just delusional, m'lady.
Hmmm I wonder how many fedoras you own
Anyone who doesn't accept music as a whole and only chooses one band is boring you obviously uncultured human waste but either way arguing about this is really dumb beauty is in the eye of the beholder now go do something productive
Exactly. Music is relative, that's what's amazing about it. Let him be though, I was the same at his age.

You can't get basic grammar right, 130 charities is a dubious at best, and you call people fags online. You're lying, mate.
Heritage the company i work at calls and collects donations for 130 charities including the special olympics i do call people fags on the internet especially when they are being fags no like i said go get off ur ass put down the computer and get a job and pay taxes u are what is wrong with the world
Don't call annoying people fags. That's an insult to gay people.

Oh, Right! So YOU, personally, don't donate to charity, but you collect calls for a company that does! Gotcha. Collecting calls is a pretty pathetic job, mate.
I never said that i don't personally donate which i do i stated that i raise money for these charities and without my "pathetic" job the special olympic couldnt host of 200 games a day world wide ms patients would be in crippling debt kids with fatal diseases wouldn't get their final wishes granted but no my job is pathetic jesus christ ur argument has so many flaws its unbearable
Slipknot-amazing lyrics
My favourite is Fall Out Boy, they have such good music, it's really easy to relate to for me and I love them Coz they are just amazing
^do you like their old stuff or their new stuff more? Also who the fuck is ALT? Do you mean All Time Low?
Beartooth
Three Days Grace! Listen to 'Fallen Angel ,' 'Unbreakable Heart' ,  'Over and Over'

Those lyrics make me cry haha. I'm such a pussy.
A board for posting love songs :-)

I know a few "emo" bands that don't get as much attention as they should. 

-The Used. They are one of my favorites. They're a mix of pop punk and post hardcore and their lyrics are incredible. I discovered them through MCR (they did a song together). Bonus, their frontman is some seriously talented hot shit.
I could name literally dozens (not emo bands though) that almost everyone here have probabaly never even heard of that would probably amaze people if they gave them a chance. :3
*slowly raises hand* I don't know if they qualify as underrated, I don't keep up with their charts, but Wolfmother is kind of awesome?
um.
Evacuate The City?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC0Pzv9OVcM
Scarlett o'hara officially ended for good in December of 2012. Most of the members reformed into a new band called kliemax. I am still a huge fan of them and despite only releasing one album it was well received but they went on hiatus shortly after only to officially end the same year. Scary kids scaring kids actually got their band name from the song of the same name by the band Cap'n Jazz. SKSK broke up in 2010 sadly ;^; but it was a mutal thing as they all agreed upon it. Sadly the singer died of a herion overdose last year.
If we're going for underrated bands, then I'd say:
Gatherers - New Jersey screamo band with an awesome original sound
Saetia - an old school screamo band from 1997ish with incredible lyrics and great musicianship that was hard to find back then.
The Ongoing Concept - Metalcore band with a sound similar to Letlive. but with a very DIY ethic. They literally built the drumset on their new album.
The Venetia Fair - Crazy mother fuckers on social media with a sound that's like My Chemical Romance's Black Parade album on meth
Stolas - Proggy post-hardcore band that are all around amazing musicians and lyricists
Animals as Leaders - Very popular, but their guitarist is playing guitar in ways nobody I know ever has and could revolutionise music if anyone can replicate how he plays.
Entheos - The old drummer from AAL and my favorite bassist ever with a guitarist from their old band and an amazing female vocalist
Inferi - A christian technical death metal band with some sick guitarists and drummer.
Troubled Coast - One of my favorite melodic hardcore bands ever. Their Ive been thinking about Leaving You EP is a masterpiece.
Such Gold - Pop punk band that missed the whole pop-punk popularity wave with TSSF and Neck Deep although theyve been at it way longer and are incredible musicians with odd time signatures and crazy chords.
Owen - Solo project of a guy named Mike Kinsella. He was the drummer for Capn Jazz (where Scary Kids Scaring Kids got their name) starting when he was only 8 years old in 1989. He also played in about 30 other bands on every instrument.
Into it. Over it. - One of Mike Kinsella's good friends and band mates in other bands. He's also a solo-musician multi-instrumentalist with a more pop-punk style.
I'll try to think of more.
Sithu Aye - Amasing solo metal musician. He writes instrumental music thats gorgeous happy metal.
Chon - Mindblowing players who also write instrumental music. They were doing Dream Theater covers when they were 11 if that tells you anything about how great they are.
Plini - Similar to Sithu Aye and also good friends, but his music is a lot softer.
I also agree with Nurr and Pocky very much.
I know its not emo but the academy is is very underrated.
I didn't think the used were underrated...at least, I think they're pretty well known among fans of mcr and the like.

Famous last words is pretty awesome
Myka Relocate
Myka Relocate
Myka Relocate
Not really emo, more pop punk of anything, but the band As It Is
Angelmaker
Slaughter to Prevail
Till Death do us Part
Everyone check out Normandie

Do you love BVB for jsu tthier looks or who they are a t hear and their music? be honest...I love them for their lyrics are inspiring and have saved me so many times! It means the world to me that they can keep me alive and going somehow
bvb is shit and anyone who listens to them should consider drinking gene pool purifier.
My favorite band is Black Veil brides bcuz Andy biersack is my daddy
THE GOOD OLD DAYS XD. I remember the first song I heared from them x3 it became my FAVORITE!!! ^-^
Sure, because you're old enough to have a daddy.
LOL He's not really my daddy I said that 2 make others jealous
Literally nobody is jealous. You probably are, of Juliet Simms.
No I'm not jealous I do luv Juliet Simms n please get off my post if youre going 2 be disrespectful
I do not understand most Emo teenagers and their bombastic infatuation with Andy. He seems like any other person, and not a deity.
Any Biersack is just a person writing music 4 his solo album I just don't want anyone being disrespectful or thinking I'm jealous becuz maybe they r jelaous that Andy is married 2 Juliet Simms
Everyone needs 2 act mature and calm down
But you're not acting mature. Hypocrite.
I'm not bullying you
lol you actually blocked me. You don't have to be afraid of me though...I won't be a cunt to you, dox you or send you hate mail. Don't have time for that shit.
Leave me alone
I like rock music and pretty much anything else but mostly rock. I want to discover more rock music so could you recommend me some music to listen to (:

I listen to loads but my favourites are bring me the horizon, falling in reversem my chemical romance, pierce the veil and black veil brides
*reverse
I prefer Ronnie in Escape The Fate.
Tbh I only liked Falling in Reverse's first album. I personally don't base my opinion of the band based on the nature of the people in the band. The music is what really speaks for itself about the band.
I like bands they are like a source of letting go of yesterday
OMFG YESSSS
I love them. I hated them for a while at first, but now I'm in love.
I love them. I hated them for a while at first, but now I'm in love.

Dude, yes. Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties is such a tear jerker. Soupy is a damn narrative genius. When I found out the last song on the album was actually a Mountain Goats cover, it crushed my soul. I had been thinking the narrator and Dianne got back together but knowing it isn't his song, I'm not sure it's meant to be part of the story.

tbh i dont listen to much folk punk bt violent femmes hold a special place in my heart !!! so does against me! but i also rlly like andrew jackson jihad
Neutral Milk Hotel is pretty rad.
Holy frick yeah, I recommend Girlpool. They're awesome
This is sorta like a poll to find the collective favourite My Chemical Romance album. Give your answer and maybe even why. As I get responses, I'll record the stats on this post.
We are talking about MCR!!All of their albums are awesome!!!Can't decide!! xc ...
Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge for me- there's just something about that sound c:. But Welcome to the Black Parade makes me feel freaking nostalgic.
Three cheers because it was basically my soundtrack back in high school
I'm into alot of different bands. I love more post hardcore bands more than anything so thats what im truly into and really into but i also like, electronica, alternative bands, pop bands, punk bands, like indie and stuff. I pretty much like bands in general no matter what genre. If your band is appealing to my ear than im going to like it. I wont judge it and say im not gonna listen to it because its too pop and ew pop (I dont like pop that much tbh) but yeah still i like the way some pop bands sound and their lyrics are genuine so whatever
my favoriat right now is davey suicide 
As long as it's creative and shows emotion it's good. I listen to everything from Explosions in the Sky to Infant Annihilator.
Shit, so many. When my emo/punk thing started it was just things like My Chemical Romance (first band I got into), Fall Out Boy, etc and as the months went by I discovered and got into new stuff, just recently into deathcore. My favorite kinds of bands are definitely alternative, post-hardcore, metalcore, and pop-punk. So it ranges from girly-ish rock like Paramore to loud stuff like Suicide Silence.
I listen to thrash/black/death metal, deathcore, old school rap, R&B;, pop, and reggae. It all depends on my mood. c:
I generally listen to hardcore music ,I mean I listen to metalcore(BVB,Asking Alexandria,Bulllet for my Valentine...),deathcore(FMS,BMTH)post-hardcore(PTV,Chiodos,SWS,Emarosa,Get Scared and more),emocore.I also listen to pop-punk,bands like ATL,Green Day and more.
Note:I listen to and am obsessed to many bands

And seriously, why the fuck isn't Tool on your list?
My favorite out of all of those are Blink-182 and Alesana.
I've heard of all of those, but I haven't really listened to a lot of them. I've always been more of a Placebo and AFI sort of "emo," but more than anything I listen to 90s grunge and a nice smattering of hardcore and punk. Bu of that list, I like Blink-182 and Puddle of Mudd. BVB brings me back to middle school, which is sort of... It's not a time I'm proud of. 5FD and Disturbed are great too. I apologize for being all over the place in this reply
I love most of those bands(: like shit man. I listen to them everyday. One question though, WHY ISNT GET SCARED ON YOUR LIST!!
i like peirce the veil, sleeping with sirens, all time low, asking alexandria, a day to remember, bring me the horizon, falling in reverse, black veil brides, and others too..
I love Alesana, I actually got into them when I was like 10, I had heard of them on deviantart when I was 9. So now I've liked them for I guess 6 years, and I've seen them 3 times since I didn't really start going to their shows until I was 14. I like a lot of other bands on here too, but hearing about Alesana is great c:
What is your theme song? Mine is Spirits by Strumbellas!
This doohickey right here.
cassettes9 said:

Yep.
My theme song would totally have to be Crazy=Genuis by P!ATD
JinxGrey said: My theme song would totally have to be Crazy=Genuis by P!ATD
So how's that your theme?
Jumpin' Jack Flash of course xD
I was born in a crossfire hurricane..!
Dead bite by Hollywood undead
My theme song would be Karma Police by Radiohead.
Favorite band? and why?
Motionless in White, because they've been around for so long and each time I've met the band it's been a good experience. There sound is great and the lyrics are extremely creative. What I'm about to say is pretty cliche for most bands, but they've shaped me into who I am today, "Open your mind before your mouth", is what I practice each and every day and ever since the first song I listened to by them, I've been in love with that band ever since.
Ik call me crazy but I love ICP because there really relateable to me. They always had hatters and they simply just didn't care. Also not a lot of people know this but they actually help out and donate to the salvation army on a weekly basis and they don't hog all there money but give it to there parents and bought them there houses. They also talk about real shit that goes on in life. Ik I'm probably gonna get that one person who says that ICP sucks but I will respond to them IDC.
Tool - Sober? Ehh I don't think it has a sound of Marilyn Manson but it's a pretty good song cxAlso has a creepy vibe to it cx

You might like em but ICP or even Twiztid. Tech n9ne and hopsin are also pretty good
The fuck is this shit?
"Skramz"?
"Emo violence"?
"Dark hardcore"?
SOMETIMES post punk?
Where did the good genres go?
The true punk?
The days of Descendents, Agent Orange, and the other great punk bands may be over, but it's time for the original punk to rise again
INK SOLDIER
@Noctem All of those bands have a place on a different label. Don't be a twat just because you like a different genre of music more.
I love black bowl bribes
I need new friends.. add me? 
Trust me, you're not going to find friends here.
Add me
Heyyyyyyyy xD
add me pwease :3
I'm new here! Add me please cx
I just joined here plz add me
hi add me
Hi, im lyn. You can add me I need friends.
You can add me
You can add me
Okaii, so i love about every emo band there is xD, but i've never really been that into bvb, but isn't it crazy all the little horny girls like the band cuz of biersacks face and proabably dont even understand the meaning of the song? haha people these days..
BVB aren't actually an emo band
So I doubt you know every emo band in existence, bet you don't know who Hawthorne Heights are
Why can't we go back to the time when Papa Roach kept our hopes up we're to be loved and the day that i promised MCR I'm not okay, to the day breaking benjamin wrote about it in Jane's diary..all the way back when Yellowcard was my only one eventhough Three Days Grace hated everything about me.I still remember when Sum 41 was with me as we sat with Good Charlotte by the river just before Blink-182 came to say I miss you. Even Linkin park felt so Numb when Avril lost grip on all this.We the kings made a sad song because I was All American Rejects ,dirty little secret. Simple pan still thinks im perfect.*faints*~linkin park..wait
Don't wake me up yet..Greenday September has not ended yet..i miss those timesCan't Evanescence just bring these fallen angels back to life?
I'm into quite a lot of bands but I really wanna get into more. anybody have any suggestions?
It would help if you told us what genres you're into.

Ever heard of RED?

Im trying to meet some fellow Metallicaholics, if there are any out there please hmu!!
I like em but I ain't that much of a fan. They are this big for a reason, can't deny that :p
yes.
Yeah man
Hell yeah \m/
Boii yass. I've been a fan since a very young age. I used to be totally obsessed, still kinda am. But yeah, huge fan here :')
Randy Blythe accidentally killed a 19 year old fan during a concert.
We see them coming a mile away
Gathered to kill on the desolate plain
No fear in our minds
Pure hate in our hearts

Miscalculation of our strength their bane
Take us lightly and we'll make you pay
Pride left them defenseless
No mercy for Hubris

They rush to fight us and we stand and wait
Pulses quicken as they take the bait
Mere seconds to slaughter
We can wait no longer

Closing fast with their weapons high
Still believing it's we that will die
Now the ambush is sprung
Now they learn they were wrong
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart

They thought it would be easy but now they're being crushed
Arrogance of power leaves them dying in their blood
There will be no mercy for these filthy sons of whores
The innards of my enemies impaled upon my sword
Many years we've waited for this final day of slaughter
Our victims are decapitated, their limbs are torn asunder
Careful preparation brought our haughty victims down
Our forces are at full strength and the time to kill is now.

Time to kill is now

Time to kill

They are all dead, it's their end today
All lost their lives in tremendous pain
Not one has survived
We left none alive

Do not doubt our conviction to kill
Hate on our side we will never fail
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart
Strike the enemy down
The time to kill is motherfucking now.
Does anyone like marilyn manson?
Love it!
Love his music 
He's ok, not my type of music. But I like the way he think, and how he can be very clever and poetic in interview. Seems like a cool guy
Yup, bullet you just reminded me about slipknot again, my neighbors are gonna get angry now XD
Yes! Very much into Marilyn Manson. I wrote a paper on him for my speech class. He's a very interesting person. Unique and open minded. He says the truth about a lot of problems in today's society.
definitely
hi
I love Marilyn Manson
Yo guy's just wondering if any of you sing or play something?  l^^|
I sing and play guitar :3
Awesome. Nice to make your acquaintance. Do you have a YouTube channel and what do you love playing ^^
Nice to meet you too. And no sadly I do not. I love rock, metal and classics.
Thanks. Oh okay well If you like Acoustic also I have some nice covers on my channel. Me too what are your faves?
I have an acoustic I just prefer electric. And it really depends on the genre :P
I'm sure I just answered this somewhere else xD
Acoustic guitar, bass & drums :) Mandolin, tiny bit of banjo & harmonica. ...Sing a little too.
I sing and write songs. I can't make music unless it's through a program, sadly. :(
I sing, scream play guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, clarinet, trumpet, baritone, tuba and i want to learn violin and chello
i sing and play the piona.. learning how to play the gutiar
I am getting singing lessons at the moment, so I (kind of) sing and play the drums.
I sing , singing is my life. Im in Two Choir's at the Moment, a Show Choir and Bella Voce which is a small all womens Choir.
I play guitar (:
I play the guitar, harp, and I play around a bit with the keyboard. I write lyrics overall, but I haven't gotten around to writing my own songs.
I Write songs, and do all unclean vocals for my band.as well as backing cleans.
I happen to be a scream-singer and lyric writer, but I've really been slacking lately XD
bloodbladeid said:
scream-singer
I'm a screamo singer
I'm in the process of learning piano and I sing XD Working towards guitar/bass and drums, then maybe onto violin or clarinet?
I sing to let my emotions go out of my body. I can't scream but I wish I could. I can't play any instrument. Is anyone interested in making new friends?
PLEASE????
YAS!!!!!!!
YAAAAY!!!
YAAAAY!!!
MOAR!!!! PTV!!!!!!
Yes!!! I love PTV! Today I had the Misadventures album in my hands but I couldn't buy it :'(
Misadventures is currently the best album ever imo
There not like popular or anything like there probs just kids in their garage but i think thier music is rlly coool! idk look them up you guys might liek them
they suck
theey r ok
There are way too many songs that I could name but I absolutely love Between The Roses (SayWeCanFly), Transatlanticism (Death Cab For Cutie), Blessed With A Curse (BMTH), Meet Me At The Gates (Blessthefall), Picture Perfect (Escape The Fate) and sooo many others
It's not my absolute favorite but Snow White VS. Elsa has a pretty good ending line...
Elsa to Snow White: "So step aside and hide go find a cottage to clean. You're one ditzy princess, I'm a mother F*ckin queen"
From an old-ish Russian song: "I commited a sin. I touched a streetwalker's tit for a sack of potatoes."
Helena or famous last words by MCR 
Almost all songs written by Kim Ljung, bassist and lyricist of Zeromancer, Seigmen and Ljungblut. Never heard anything like this! *____* Also IAMX and Camouflage songs, very impressive too!
i write sins not teagidies by panic at the disco
Sound of Silence cover by Disturbed..
For me, it's hands down "Blackstar," by David Bowie. I'm also really partial to an old BVB song called The Gunsling. I know both song's lyrics by heart now.
You could have a steam trainIf you'd just lay down your tracksYou could have an aeroplane flyingIf you bring your blue sky backAll you do is call meI'll be anything you needYou could have a big dipperGoing up and down, all around the bendsYou could have a bumper car, bumpingThis amusement never endsI want to be your sledgehammerWhy don't you call my nameOh let me be your sledgehammerThis will be my testimonyShow me round your fruitcage'Cause I will be your honey beeOpen up your fruitcageWhere the fruit is as sweet as can beI want to be your sledgehammerWhy don't you call my nameYou'd better call the sledgehammerPut your mind at restI'm going to be-the sledgehammerThis can be my testimonyI'm your sledgehammerLet there be no doubt about itSledge sledge sledgehammerI've kicked the habitShed my skinThis is the new stuffI go dancing in, we go dancing inOh won't you show for meAnd I will show for youShow for me, I will show for youYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean youOnly youYou've been coming throughGoing to build that powerrBuild, build up that power, heyI've been feeding the rhythmI've been feeding the rhythmGoing to feel that power, build in youCome on, come on, help me doYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, youI've been feeding the rhythmI've been feeding the rhythmIt's what we're doing, doingAll day and night
Spirit Breaker by August Burns Red

Staring at the walls to pass the time.
Pinch myself make sure I'm still alive.
I'm not alright.
It's become a disguise.
Friends and family, I'm losing all ties.
Staring at the walls to pass the time.
Pinch myself; make sure I'm still alive.
I've been here before.
I will survive another month under gray skies.
I'm holding on as a tight as I can.
The monotony never seems to end.
Every day feels the same.
Every day I think about the place I'd rather be than here.
I've been here before.
I will survive another month under these grey skies.
We've carried each other through and over the seas.
We live for nights like this.
The ones we won't forget. I hope to open my eyes to see this picture.
I'm throwing it all away. I hope to open my eyes to see this moment that I should treasure forever.
Staring at the walls to pass the time.
Pinch myself; make sure I'm still alive.
I'm not alright.
It's become a disguise.
Friends and family, I'm losing all ties.
I'm holding on as tight as I can.
Coming home, I don't know when.
I'm holding on as tight as I can.
I swear.
My dearest love, I woke up tired today, even more so than yesterday.
How that's possible, I don't even know, nor do I want to. It's hard to find the motivation when you are this drained. My body aches but I'm used to feeling this way.
Seventeen down, seventeen to go.
That's not so bad, right?
I think of home often and of you even more.
Yesterday I saw the sun shining. It appeared for a few minutes just after two.
For a moment I found myself smiling, as if those short rays of light were enough to get me by.
Maybe that was enough.
Thank God, I needed that.
I surely needed that.
Make Them Suffer- Let Me In. First time I heard those lyrics, it made me tear up a bit. Here they are;
My dear Annie,won't you please let me in.I know that I've made some mistakes.I'm so sorry,I was never really there.I'm just so sorry that I never even tried.
But you saw through my lies.My endless lies.
Take me to a better place,where I can breathe the air,where I can smile.This house is getting smallerand the blinds are all shut.Please help me to smile.
I know that I've made some mistakes,But I'm only a manand i'm sorry, so sorryI can't let you in.Just a shell of a man,There's no more of me to give.
But it's not going to finish,it's not going to stop.I'm not going to throw in the towel.I'm gonna fix myselfone day at a time.I won't hurt you no moreI just can't hurt you no more.
Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in.Just let me breathe again.Because I'm not okay, no i'm not alright.I hope that you're doing just fine.
Let me go.You saw through my lies, my endless lies,But you never let me go.Just fucking let me go, trust me you deserve betterJust fucking let me go, I'm just no good for you anymore.
My dear Annie,won't you please let me in.I know that I've made some mistakes.I'm so sorry, but I tried and I tried.It was never enough for you.
Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in.Just let me breathe again.Because I'm not okay, no i'm not alright.I hope that you're doing just fine.
Because I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried,But it wasn't enough.I promise I'll fix this one day at a time.Just don't forget me,Just please don't forget me.

It's shit.
Bullshit. Your tastes aren't vast in any sense of the word.
Yes, because other people who have no idea who I am would know better right? Not myself.
By the description you've provided, your tastes are laughably narrow. Bit if you'd like to provide more information, go ahead
Listen to classical and folk music too, then you could say your tastes are vast.
Amen. Music Concrete or whatever, too.
For one I listed a few genres I listen to that seems like genres people using this website would know about. It doesn't mean I don't listen to Folk, Classical and other things. And two, I just asked for good music ideas, not people bitching about what I do or don't listen to. My music taste is vast, it doesn't mean I'm in the mood to type everything I like down.
Ok well I'm a sucker for European bands so for fun I'll suggest some you'll probably like:
Nightwish
Epica
HIM
Amaranthe
Arch Enemy
Within Temptation
Franz Ferdinand
Hawkwind
Seasick Steve
Laurie Anderson
Public Service Broadcasting
They're only two genres. That's really not that vast.
i think i figured you out cassettes you are a member of the sub culture that is considered a plague by other sub cultures wich ofcourse is the oh so dreadful hipster xD
haha everything you have posted and the cynical almost laughable negativity towards others like somekind of selfproclaimed king of everything fucking snob points towards the hipster crowd oh shit haha i bet you have a trilby too and listens to everything noone else listens to so you can feel special and "educated"
haha your behaviour is sad and cute all at once :P
My dad's been listening to Franz Ferdinand since 2005...so no
no but as you say "your dad" and this guy fits the hipster image perfectly have you seen that all he has written is negativity in all forms and lack of knowledge
Actually, I have demonstrated knowledge of political situations, you're just unwilling to understand that politics isn't just right wing bollocks. And negativity is my schtick, you know? Give these fellows some criticism every now and then. You know the deal.
I'll take a crack at it. I saw the dweeb saying shit like "your tastes are laughably narrow" so I scrolled to the bottom and idk what anyone else posted.

Start off with metal:
classic metal- Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath which Im sure you know.
Thrash- Metallica and Anthrax are a good start.
Death metal- Death, Cannibal Corpse, Inferi, Devourment, and Heaven Shall Burn are rad
black- Mesarthim, Darkthrone, Deaf Heaven
metalcore- Every Time I Die, Sky Eats Airplane, Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza
prog- Periphery, BTBAM, Dream Theater, Animals As Leaders

punk is probably my favorite genre so
hardcore punk- Black Flag, Minor Threat, Shitty Weekend
hardcore- Knocked Loose, Defeater, Turnstile, Madball, Altona, Touche Amore
post-hardcore- Dance Gavin Dance, At the Drive In, The Venetia Fair, Glassjaw, Letlive
pop-punk - With the Punches, Kid Liberty, Major League
Folk-punk - Jesse Stewart, Wingnut Dishwashers Union, My Pizza My World, Railyard Ghosts
ska-punk -Less than Jake, Be Like Max
Emo- Sorority Noise, Capn Jazz, The World Is... Rites of Spring
screamo- Saetia, Pg. 99, The Saddest Landscape, Raein, Circle takes the Square, Orchid, Suis La Lune, Caravels

Some random genres
Mathrock- The Speed of Sound In Seawater,  TTNG, Covet, Chon
Post-rock- Tortoise, Explosions In the Sky, God is an Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor
Rap/Hip-hop - Oddisee, Run the Jewels, Vonnegutt, 
Soul- So Much Light, Zelliack
Rock and Roll- The Beatles, Beach Boys
Folk- Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan
Classical- Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi, Tchaikovsky

And trust me here. Listen to country music. Particularly, Willie Nelson's Red-Headed Stranger album. Also Merle Haggard, Charlie Poole, and Charlie Daniels.
suuup im quinntin add me im new to this i wanna make some new friends so add me message me whatever you want :)

Laurie Anderson, guys. Listen to Laurie Anderson.
Melanie Martinez, Twenty One Pilots, Depeche Mode, and Alexander Rybak.

Oddisee is a great rapper if you haven't heard him. Also, there's a group called Nobel that mixes pop with classical instrumentation that's really cool. One of the 2 members was in The Human Abstract.

He's not only hot, he's the sweetest band member you could ever meet!

So please, delete yourself, lol.
IT'S ALL DUMB AZN SHIT. THUS, YOU ARE A WEEABOO.
I started getting into K-pop a few months back thanks to my one friend. It's one of my new favorite things.
fav kpop groups~?
I really like SHINee,GOT7, EXO, Super Junior and I like some Girl's Generation but I'm not as big into them.
i'm just a big believer in block b 
I'm slowly starting to like them. Any song suggestions?
deffinetly the song her
So I'm guessing most of you guys won't be familiar with this band, but they've been my jam for the last few weeks. It's upbeat with great lyrics. That's all I'm gonna say.
Here's a link to their best album in full on YouTube :)
I really want to start learning electric guitar to play rhythm in my band (we're failing at finding a rhythm guitar and drummer so far) but I'm not sure where to start. I don't know much about guitar models but ideally my first one would be pretty lightweight.
Ibanez guitar sound good,they are not heavy...
A nice acoustic is a good start tbh... 
Unless you solely want to play electrics then start with a fender strat or something.
just spend 30 to 50$ on an acoustic guitar to practice, no need to get anything higher than that since you are only starting.
I'd recommend an acoustic. Anything that is playable should be just fine.
Epiphone starter kits are the best bang for the buck imo.
I started with an Ibanez Gio, and thats a pretty good place to start as far as electric goes. Fender starter acoustics are the best as far as beginner acoustics go. As far as which one to get, it depends on what music you wanna play. Strats are okay, but only if you're looking to play softer-core stuff. Epiphone starters are pretty great too, and sound a bit meatier than an ibanez, but have a little less shredability

I actually already have an acoustic, my sister and I share it because we're both learning. However I've heard that electric is a bit harder to play.
That is completely wrong. Acoustic strings are way heavier.
...They don't have to be? O.o
Yeah, they actually do. Acoustics have shorter scale lengths, so to keep tension they need heavier strings.
Light gauge strings for acoustic start on a .12 or a .13, while light electric strings start on a .9 or a .10
bla bla bla actually.
It's all preference.
Actually I've been playing guitar for 7 years, acoustic and electric, so stop talking out of your ass. Google it if you think I'm wrong.
Actually you're not the only musician in the world, I've been playing also since I was 6.
preferencepreferencepreferencepreferencepreferencepreferencepreferencepreference
Guys....no
You cant even buy acoustic guitar strings lighter than an .12, maybe if you're lucky you'll find a .11, but I've never seen any
You can. I personaly like having 10s on my acoustic.... Is my preference.
I'm not saying that it isn't preference, but in general, acoustics come stock with .12s or .13s, and most people play with heavier strings.
Alright, Both of you seem to be more of acousitc players, and I'll admit, I don't know nearly as much about acoustics as I do electrics, so lets agree to disagree. Personally, when I play acoustic, I use .13's or .14's, and I use .12's or .13s when I play electric, so I'm definately biased towards heavier strings. I have no idea what you mean by "an electric guitar cannot be carried to easily"
There is no such thing as a nylong string electric guitar.

Hahahahaha..
I'm poor so I still have my fender strat, these guitars go way back. I later purchased a Yamaha acoustic which I then even more later forgot in someone's car, still have to sue the guy. When I started I was told to go acoustic, tbh I just made a lot of noise with electric, my reason for having acoustic before electric is that you get to take it out for jams.

Sleeping with sirens defenetly i especially love the quote by Kellin Q. "Sometimes youve gotta fall before you fly."
That and Pierce the veil "Darling you'll be okay" they have helped me alot by getting through self mutilation, im a year clean
Lostprophets was awesome until the charges of child molestation were presented against the singer, Ian Watkins, which was when he decided to throw away his entire life, career, public view, and everything as we know it. From now on he's considered a perverted freak. I don't disagree. But I still listen to his music because anybody is capable of doing what he did. He was struggling with his inner demons and they won the fight. His song "Rooftops" really spoke to me. It had lyrics like "when our time is up, when our lives are done, will we say we've had... our fun?" He was such a great singer, I felt destroyed as soon as I heard the news. At least with Dimebag Darrell he'll forever and always be remembered as a great guitarist, but he will only be remembered by that bullshit. I say that everybody is capable of doing what he did, it's just that it takes a certain type of person to actually do it. Just because you've listened to an artist for such a time and then find out that he's a pervert, that doesn't automatically mean you should stop listening to them. The music was fine, it was just their actions. What if the singer from Five Finger Death Punch turned out to be a cold blooded serial killer who targeted women and children? What if that turned out to be something he was convicted of? Would you automatically go to yourself "well, I guess that's another album from my spotify that I'm gonna have to delete" or do you say to yourself "well, what he did was wrong. But just because of all this bullshit that's going on, am I just gonna fucking use that against the rest of the band, or am I going to accept his legacy, but still not support him for what he did"?
How do Attila lyrics help you through...?

Given choices before she started living

are you self taught or have you had lessons?
My mom is a singer, she taught me, and I taught myself a little.
Soooo, I've loved music for most my life, I've heard music from every genre like, ever, and I've heard some reaaaallly good songs, but never have I ever heard a band that was better than NOTHING MORE, like oh my fuckin God, all there songs are fuckin AMAZIN, only thing I don't like is the vocalists hair.... LOL BUT ANYWAY, their music is fuckin awesome, I suggest you listen to them sometimes, I suggest their song I'll Be Ok....
Not bad
We're gonna be an alternative/pop punk band, inspired by Paramore. There's just three of us so far; lead vocalist, bassist/backup vocalist, and lead guitarist.
Ideally we want people around our ages (16-19) who live in Georgia, preferably around Atlanta. If you're interested and have kik, post or msg me your username and I'll add you to our group chat.

Alphabetically ordered list of bands! Can't help but think I've missed something???? Help? Xxx
Missing one of my favorite bands, Bullet For My Valentine. Also, you messed up the alphabetical order a few times, especially in the "THE" section
What exactly is the purpose of this
Anyone else listen to the Finnish band HIM? In the "goth" category, they're my favorite. My favorite songs by them are Buried Alive by Love and Vampire Heart.

I have 5 fravert bands they are Black veil brides , new years day , vampires everywhere ,  fall out boy, afi , and thirty seconds to mars. What are your fravert bands ?? I love rock and any music.
PLEASE TELL ME SOME HERE LISTENS TO PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING.
PLEASE.
I do :P
yeah, I do
A lot of people say that music saved their life, but I think it's done that differently for everyone. I'm curious about how people on here have been affected by music.
I've always loved music, but I never considered a career in it until I was 14. I used to want to become a marine biologist and in 8th grade I started to realize I just wasn't bright enough to go into science. Also in 8th grade I dealt with bullying and fear that I'd fail classes and get left back, just like my previous middle school years. I started teaching myself to sing to beat my depression. It started out as just a hobby but at the beginning of freshman year I decided it would be good if I pursued a career in classical singing. I don't know what I'd be doing right now if I hadn't started singing. There's nothing else I'd rather do with my life.
music has given me freedom in my own world when I feel lost or my depression is weighing me down. I feel it helps because I can focus better when music is plaing I just honestly let go of everything else
rock music has helped me become stronger it's helped me with my depression and my anxiety even when therapy doesn't work, it has made an inpacked in my life so much.
music was a bigger help than therapy, so I understand
it's pretty similar for me. that's pretty weird. i've wanted to be a marine biologist for a long time now, more than half my life, but i don't know if i'm smart enough. i'll keep trying, though, and studying what i can. i can't sing, though, so i started teaching myself piano, guitar, harp, whistle, and writing stuff, trying to find my outlet through music and know i will have something to persue in case i do end up failing. singing is a great way for me to let out anxiety, though, but only when no one is around :V
music saved me though not only because it's an outlet for myself, but because of other artists who i could relate to. they saved me through their music, and inspired me enough to keep improving myself, or whenever i lost the motivation to do anything about a situation i was in. music is the only thing i can trust enough to welcome into my heart without worrying that it will be torn away from me someday. without worrying about anything at all, because all i need to focus on is the music. and the thought that i can connect to the heart of another person in such a deep way is comforting sometimes, even if i never spoke to that person. it's quite lovely and i'm very grateful to music, and to the fact that i can always rely on it.
Music has helped me through hard times. Whenever I can't face people and just want to be left alone, I put my headphones in. It also helps me get through thunderstorms.Music in my ears let me focus on the words rather than the world around me.
Thread for anyone who is a fan of the metalcore genre. My favorite metalcore bands are Bring me the Horizon and Of Mice & Men.
I love bring me the horizon and mice & men
hi I'm Stevie
so I bought The Flood (om&m;) today and it's so fireee
zao tho
Amidst the Grave's Demons is the best metalcore band ever.
I love Suicide Silence.
^same. No Time to Bleed is probably my favorite album of theirs. hbu?
parkway drive, ERRA, august burns red, as blood runs black :)
hey everyone. bored out of my mind,so i figured i would put together a compilation of all my favorite artists.
DAGAMES
Groundbreaking
The Living Tombstone
trying to explore new types of music,so if anyone has a suggestion,feel free to let me know.
i guess this is somewhat unorthodox in a largely emo community but i absolutely love LORDE
omg she's the best c:
i recommend "glory and gore", "400 lux", and "buzzcut season". buzzcut season is definitely the most underrated song on her debut album pure heroine, currently so in love with it

Postmodern Jukebox is an interesting take on modern music. Can't go wrong with Judas Priest
Step 1: Stop listening to Falling in Reverse
Step 2: Start listening to Silverstein, Dance Gavin Dance, State Champs, and Issues.
some of my faves are Get Scared, Nothing More, Three Days Grace
Asking alexandria, 3oh!3, all time low, attila, august burns red, black veil brides, blood on the dance floor, bring me the horizon, bullet for my valentine, capture the crown, a day to remember, the devil wears prada, falling in reverse, get scared, ghost town, hollywood undead, linkin park, my chemical romance, motionless in white, memphis may fire, miss may i, neck deep, never shout never, of mice and men, our last night, panic! at the disco, pierce the veil, sleeping with sirens, suicide silence, sick puppies, skillet, the red jumpsuit apparatus, the ready set, the summer set, thousand foot krutch, we came as romans,
Well you should definatley listen to silverstein if you haven't, blind witness, underoath,  cursive, beartooth,  saosin, thursday, and chiodos are all really great bands

ATTILAAAAAAA. :D
Crystal said: ATTILAAAAAAA. :DWHAT THEYRE GOING WHAT HEKLX LYIuhh yA
DUR. ITS GOING TO BE GR8.
ATL AND BVB AND PTV
BoyMeetsWorld is pretty cool. And Mooseblood is probably one of the best bands playing. August Burns Red is obviously the #1 band at Warped most of the time, though.
Escape the Fate, Atilla,Senses Fail, and the Amity Affliction :D
Went to warped yesterday ^-^ it was the best day ever!!! I don't really like Attila but they were fun to headbang to lol. And I met New Years Day!!!!
Pierce The Veil
Probably Black Veil Brides and Pierce the Veil. I also go for the YouTubers though c:
Black Veil Brides and Pierce the Veil!! ^=^~ yay. So excited! *dances*
It was amazing.  The bands I wanted to see where.  Attila,  bless the fall,  new years day,  black veil brides,  the relapsed symphony and many more
Thisbwas my 3rd warped and it was the best so far, I got in my first pit seeing baao, and silverstein was amazing and so was beartooth!
There are a lot of genres in the music scene but a lot of people mis-label them so I thought I'd try my best to help.

Hardcore - An offshoot of punk that is heavier and generally faster than standard punk. Fast punk beats and d-beats on drums, and simple guitar riffs on the 6th and 5th strings played in power chords are characteristic. Vocals are generally shouted, but sometimes sang, screamed, or spoken. Songs are generally short, between 1 and 3 minutes. Songs often have sections played in half time with simpler instrumentation to emphasize heaviness called a "breakdown."(Black Flag, Madball, Altona, etc.)

Metalcore - A cross of hardcore and metal obviously. Generally has a mix of harsh vocals and clean vocals. The harsh vocals have a timbre between shouting of hardcore and the style of harsh vocals found in various forms of metal from thrash to death and have a larger octave range than other styles of harsh vocals. Drumming generally leans more to the hardcore side whereas the guitar has a low string chugging for a rhythm with a metal lead over it. Breakdowns in metalcore are different from hardcore: still played in half time, but the guitar is generally just the lowest chugging their guitars can manage following the bass drum. (Shai Hulud, August Burns Red,  Blessthefall, As I Lay Dying, etc.)

Post-Hardcore - This genre grew from hardcore punk in the late 1980's, pioneered by the band Fugazi (which was started by Ian Mackaye who was the first bassist of Black Flag [the first hardcore band] 10 years prior). The sound is derivative of hardcore but has grown and branched out into a lot of different styles. Vocals are usually sang with some harsh vocals thrown in that are usually higher in pitch with a clearer timbre and often don't have much range. The songs are longer and softer than hardcore and metalcore. There's a lot of different styles within post-hardcore and it has more innovation than other styles. (Fugazi, Thursday, Brand New, La Dispute, At the Drive In, Pierce the Veil, Dance Gavin Dance, etc.)

Emo -This genre began as a way taking hardcore ethics and ideas, such as DIY, non-pop-structured songs, and lyrical themes, but with music that wasn't hardcore. Vocals can be sang or screamed, but are usually somewhere between. The clean vocals are often slightly off-pitch on the high end. It sounds really angsty, as well. If the singer can sing well, its probably not emo. (Rites of Spring, I Hate Myself, American Football, Old Gray, Tiny Moving Parts, etc.)

Screamo - Here's where most people get confused. Not everything with harsh vocals is screamo. True screamo is emo +screaming. Not the kind of screaming you hear in metalcore or post-hardcore. It is literal screaming. If it doesn't sound like the singer is dying or crying, it isn't emo (I'm pretty sure they are crying sometimes). The drums are usually crazy beats with simple power chords on guitar, and usually a really soft/slow build up in the beginning or middle of the song. Lots of off-time playing too. (Saetia, Pg.99, Pianos Become the Teeth, the Saddest Landscape, Merchant Ships, etc.)

This is not a debate, this is a PSA. These are not opinions, these are facts. Black Veil Brides is not emo or screamo. Bring Me The Horizon is not emo or screamo. My Chemical Romance is not emo or screamo. kthx bai
I defnitely should have added that, thanks. I think it has something to do with the guitars in deathcore being chuggier, having breakdowns, and being more downtempo. There's also melodic death metal (Heaven Shall Burn type stuff), technical death metal (Rings of Saturn, Inferi) and slam death metal (Party Cannon, Devourment) so it gets confusing.

https://youtu.be/KVYu9XFgI44 This might help though
Man there's a lot of pretentious elitists in those comments. Great video though.
Preach cx It's probably the most irritating thing ever when someone calls bands like Pierce the Veil and Black Veil Brides metal for the little amount of harsh vocals included in some of their songs.
issues are awesome
You should definatly check out Starset, they are a newer band (they formed around 2013 or something) but they are awesome

Best bands from the 90's were Pg.99, Orchid, Saetia, American Football, Braid, Cannibal Corpse, Fugazi, and City of Caterpillar.
I've been on Emowire for nearly a year now and I've met many amazing new people here in that time, but one thing I've noticed over that time is that my taste in music seems to differ greatly from the vast majority of users here, who seem to share common musical interests. This doesn't bother me, because it gives me a chance to do something I love doing - which is sharing new music with people and expanding their musical taste.
I did this with one of my closest friends here (and am continuing to do so) and loved every minute of it, so if anyone else is interested in taking a "musical journey" (yes, I know that sounded lame xD) with me, feel free to message me. :3 Music is a truely massive passion of mine and I want to connect with people who feel the same way. ^_^ Skype is my much prefered option for this sort of thing, but not mandatory.
sup ill be glad to share new music whit you anytime
Im always here c':
Meeeeeeeeeee
That's super cool and yah what type of genre or ect. do you listen to? I have always been different from everyone around me, though i love music with a passion and very widely diverse about what music i listen to! Do you supporrt new bands as well?! So anyways i would love to share music with youXD Oh i'm also a song writter, Hhave you written any music!?
Anyone who replied to this thread and wants to talk, just inbox me whenever you're free and I'll write back asap. :3
Sure okay!!
What is better also include 80`s and early 90`s  into this but what do you prefer?
I like it if it's good. I personally dont like many new bands. They just have no originality thee days :/ it all sounds the same. :p
i grew up with alot of the oldies like, black sabeth, ozy, mettalica,ac/dc, zz top, motley crue, ect ect there are some good bands today but they just dontb rlly compare to the old ones
Each generation of music just branches out and makes things more extreme in whatever direction. Nobody would have attempted death metal in the 60's, and nobody would have attempted mixing with jazz until just a few years ago. The only way for music to be bad is for it to be unoriginal.
The evolution of rock is very interesting to me. I don't believe the quality of music has changed, so I get annoyed when rock "elitists" insist it has.

The Beatles were the first band I was ever into (I was really young, like around 4) and I also like Bon Jovi, Queen, Nirvana, etc in addition to the modern bands I love.

For all my whitechapel fans out there this is the topic to discuss
I love whitechapel!!
its the shizznizz
Ive never listened to them, but I know their drummer. From what I've learned they are brutal.
If you have some sort of poetry or lyrics, post them here and share :DRegardless if it's a deep metal song, or a depressing melody and backstory, maybe a swaggy rap song, even a very symbolic poetry,I'm bored and I want to see what you guys have in mindAnd you should probably tell people not to steal your ideas xDIf, that is, this post gets noticed ;-; . I have an act for it not getting noticed xD
I'm going to try my hand at free writing here

A kiss
Of dew
A blade 
Of grass
A heart
Of two
Shattered
Like glass
Pieces
Of Memories
Stories
Of tragedies
No stars
To cross
No truth
But loss
A kiss 
From you
A blade
Of steel
My heart
To you
This blade
I feel...

Sorry about the choppy alignment I'm on mobile and such anyways thanks for reading :)
Not finished yet could use some advice though


How to overcome depression


        My life is empty. Empty of love, action, family, and friends.
    Drowning in a river of emotions, pulling me out to a sea of isolation.
The cuts leak blood that increase the size of the sea
    The pills dissolve into the sea making it unable to sustain life.
    No fish and no birds, no plants left as far as the eyes can see.
But the pills don't help, the scars don't go away
       The scars are like an oil spill streaking through the water tpurple across my pale arms.
           A figure appears upon the horizon, a beautiful women with porcelain skin
She's perfect not thin
8/9/16
GETAWAY
the hooks are screwed to place, the nails hammered as hard as the walls can take.is the music pounding your ears?is it enough to cover the sounds?are the doors locked tonight, for the last time around.
ignorant child or ignorant parents?we're all ignorant to the pain we bring.it's not puberty, it's not a fucking phase.have they ever asked who owns the blades on the kitchen sink?
all you ever wanted was a hand to hold.a voice to hear, that isn't your own.not the voices in your head, nor the voices of the crowd.they don't know how it drives you mad when the silence gets too loud.
when the ropes are missing, when they start hearing tears.you take a step and forget all your fears.as each step you take determines your fate.and they rush to your room for all is at stake.but by the time, the last step, you make.you've always been dead inside, so it has always been,
too late.
Oh twilight-- As I try to rest,
Though I twist and turn,
You still mock and jest
And yet still Inside I burn
Riddles crash inside my mind
Silent screaming skies
What's thou I cannot find?
What heart knows but mind denies--
A love beats within my breast
With silent lips yet still I lay,
Coward's heart in my chest
Lest be troubled til comes day;
Oh love within my beaten heart--
Mend my soul with petals soft
Though are angel and art--
Dreams of you come oft
But fade like summers nights 
Wishful dreaming as it may be
Now beneath heaven's lights
I drift to dream; of you and me.
More to come, maybe.
Pretty kwel
Thank you!
No problem
I like the cats. Very pastel goth ish.
COOL :DD
Thank you.

awesome.
your work is fantastic
thanks :D realy appreciate it most see my work to "hardcore"
yeah well most are cunts.
i really like your work, you're not bad at drawing and sketching as a whole, i can see that. i like the way you've only used red when it's needed, it's not over the top and the lack of other colours really makes it pop.
i like the actuall drawings too, i think they're sick. keep it up
thanks! :D awesome to see that there is till people who hasnt subscribed to the bs that is todays mainstream nickiminaj 1direction and the other totally bland copypaste pop culture bullshit :D i usually get looks of "are you allright in the head?" realy nice to find people who appreciate my work :)
Wow, you're extremely tallented! Very impressive work. Even if people think it's morbid no one could deny that you have a lot of talent.
Thanks yeah they say kinda that but  allways add"but you shouldnt draw that its not healthy" but i draw best when im upset and angry or otherwise emotional :) and this is a couple of examples of what comes out on the paper ;)

made this now i got pretty satisfied with the result :)
That's not his second account banned, it's his fifth. The staff of this site can't figure out how to ban IP addresses.
thanks and yeah i noticed that 100% of all his crap was negative slandering and ripping on people in various ways, its pathetic that he has that little to do in his life that he can sit and make fake account after fake account he must be a very sad and pathetic individual
He's 13, he probably doesn't have much else to do.
It's pathetic that you waste time feeding trolls after they explicitly tell you they're taking the piss. 
Well are you a troll or a kid who gets off on being an asshole? Make up your mind, damn
Nah.





awesome.
your work is fantastic
thanks :D realy appreciate it most see my work to "hardcore"
yeah well most are cunts.
i really like your work, you're not bad at drawing and sketching as a whole, i can see that. i like the way you've only used red when it's needed, it's not over the top and the lack of other colours really makes it pop.
i like the actuall drawings too, i think they're sick. keep it up
thanks! :D awesome to see that there is till people who hasnt subscribed to the bs that is todays mainstream nickiminaj 1direction and the other totally bland copypaste pop culture bullshit :D i usually get looks of "are you allright in the head?" realy nice to find people who appreciate my work :)
Wow, you're extremely tallented! Very impressive work. Even if people think it's morbid no one could deny that you have a lot of talent.
Thanks yeah they say kinda that but  allways add"but you shouldnt draw that its not healthy" but i draw best when im upset and angry or otherwise emotional :) and this is a couple of examples of what comes out on the paper ;)

I've changed my mind. I haven't a clue how to post pictures
Oh fairenough well if you change your mind, you can email me the pictures you want to post i don't mind.
ms kassidykillz :)
I would just say focus on your proportions, the way I learned it was to pick a part of your drawing to use as the measuring stick for the rest, try to pick something that could fit into the other parts equally
Thanks Kolvx sounds like good advice, are make sure I try that on the next one.
yeah i agree with kolvx and dont ever look at it as a whole so to speak, think of an anatomy doll (you know those everyone had in artclass) that is a very simple way actually to learn proportions and make it look natural :)
Emo couple!

Hey my bf and I are emo can I send a pic
So cool this makes me wish i had a emo bf or just a bf really XD

Out of space the queen of the sun Shone brightly as soon as she gazed upon Igloo icy figure that was the prince of ice their eyes met and it was an instant attraction they tried for years and years to get close to each other but only to fail and for every time they tried to kiss the queen of the Sun would go out and the prince of ice would. Melt and when they finally realize that their love could not be the queen of the sun go inside the Sun to burn for all eternity and the prince of ice froze his self never to Breathe Again the only way they could live for all eternity

cheers ds
I knew he was a troll thanks
Dont touch fire! that shit'll burn you yo!
Why did you make 3 same topics ?
We all know that. You're only feeding him by posting this. Nice job.
and the only thing that a troll cant stand is silence so now that i know that he is a troll and i wasted alot of time on him i thought since i saw him attacking newcommers who do not know he is a troll to give them a headsup
That is thoughtful to think of newcomers like that C:

Hey! So Ice wanted to start a YouTube channel for a while, but I have no idea what I want to do on it, like. I'm okay with makeup, I'm kinda funny, and I'm a bit of a dork. Do you guys have any suggestions for what I should do? Also I'm new to the website !
Just do vlogs. You can talk about topics you think are interesting and know about, or things thAt you Don't know all that much about but have input on.
O...m...g... That blue skull and rose one is drop dead gorgeous. I love all of them but that one is just wow.
Yeah that one took forever i put in alot of time into doing it and making sure the colors were right. After doing it uploaded into my drawing tablet sofware and sharpend it . Should finished the others but never had the time to do it.
Damn, you're drawings are epic. Ever considered becoming a tattoo artist? Seriously looks like you have the talent for it. :3
Oh...G...A....W....D THIS IS EPIC!
Fucken mean. Love it
hi here is a set of tattoos i made on myself with a johnny irons machine and alla prima paint (the guy in gasmask and helmet was my first selfmade had to do it upside down so i am happy with the outcome i have outlined so you can see them better)
Them tattoos look so cool:)
thanks! :D appreciate it :3
your welcome:)
wow.. you made it yourself. you and those tattoos are cool!
Thanks never been called cool before haha :D  awesome that you likey haha :3
Not bad man :D You got some skills!
thanks i "train" on myself to get better but since i have been drawing since i knew what a pen was its just like holding a heavier pen with an engine :3 so its going pretty good :D
Same :) Why buy pig ears from the butcher when I've got a walking blank sheet right here? Hahaha ^_^
haha exactly what i said well i said "i rather buy some new gasmask or various tattoo equipment than buying the skin of a dead pig or synthetic skin" so my skin works fabulously and i have a suspisiously skyhigh pain threshold (it proves very interesting during more intimate activities haha ;D)
Fair play ^_^ Haha
I just said "well there will do" xD
haha yeah i kinda get some impulse some days/night where i could be sitting watching vikings and suddenly my adhd mind kicks in and tells me "hey wouldnt a badass tattoo be just awesome to make right now! " haha oh adhd u so silly and sometimes pretty annoying but mostly its nice :3
Hello.
I want to have some friends who have the same hobby or favorite things as me. So yeah I'll add you if you want to, just comment ok.

I draw a lot of manga anime and fanart.
Well, i ship sasusaku and okikagu.

We can ask for advice or comment and share our arts together. Or we can just talk about some random anime manga related or unrelated things. I hope we get along and be a good friends. I'll be happy.

Have a beautiful day!
You.Sound.Amazing! I love anime and drawing anime. We should totally share arts sometime! ^.^

So again, what kinda stuff are you gonna upload? Just readings of horror stories?
Im writing horror stories about stuff that seems very realisitic, the simplicity is that its happening to anyone, And everyone, its about kidnapping stories, Murders, Walking into murder scenes, Police stories, EMT stories, stories of people working at mental hospitals. You name it.
The most disturbing part is not that all of it is supernatural or seemingly over the top hollywood stuff. it could happen to you.
THANK YOUUUU!!!! XD
:P. Not like that dear.
With a nice little cup'a whiskey. xD

Really cool!
I'm extra jealous because I can't draw hands for shit cx Awesome concept, I love the oriental wave paintings, this is a really cool take on that style.
Aww thank you so much ^_^
The title says it all! Post your favourite photograph that you've taken in your artistic career c: Pictures related, of course. I took these two photos during a flash freeze in 2013. The roses behind my school were still in bloom when the first snow hit us, and it made for some excellent pictures.
I love roses


I can only right in cursive its my defult setting...I can print but it ends up in cursive anyway...
Nice c:
Awesome picture and I love your cursive :) I can only write in cursive too xD
Cool
I can appreciate this. I think it'd make a good song as well.
I agree, it would be an awesome song, I like the patterns of ur rhyming as well as the syllable pattern :)
Thanks you guys :) I might try to make it a song eventually.
Hey, I'm John and I'm doing just what the title says, I'm 18 and I plan to be an artist. Basically I'm gonna do some work and put it on my profile, I'd like for you people out there to check it out, and if you have any suggestions as what to do or how I can approve that'd be pretty cool, other than that I want some other people to talk to because I'm all alone at night, so message me and maybe we can chat. Other than that let me know what you think about my work when I finally get around to posting it on my profile page.
Have you checked out the art school in Chicago? One of my best friends/male twin goes there and our friend, Gregor, is one of the art teachers. Its an amazing school. If interested, I would love to put you in touch with them. They know all the good stuff.
I'm also applying at an art school nice!
Hey im gonna start my own youtube doing challenges and covers so any suggestions are appreciated
Just don't do the cinnamon challenge lol u have a YouTube channel and I did that one it is terrible

Awe! Super adorable!
Thats so cool!
Thank you :)
Well, since I love art it also has a special meaning to me :) So the design itself doesn't need to be "my grandma" but just something I find beautiful and would love to have on my body, because I see it as art and art means alot to me.
But I don't want strangers to find THE design and then just take it because they said so, I just need some inspiration:)

So we have decided to add the quiz feature back to the site again. I think it can be fun for everyone. You can create quizzes by follow this link http://emowire.com/quizzes/create
My rank actually dropped, by 100, why?
I didn't get 1,000 extra credits .-.
Neither did I .-. Haha
Never got mine either... :(
heh heh Lucky me :P
How about me?
Never got any either ;-;
I didn't either. And where exactly is there a place to spend them?
Yes I read that you are supposed to spend them to give another member something. Where is the store that it mentioned?
I'd like to know about the store too.
At this point, I've given up on credits.
I still don't even know how you're really supposed to use them -_- had no answers about this store thing so far.
Yeah. When is that store coming in hmmm? :| been awhile since we've heard anything about it.
So you're expecting relpies from Truth? Wow, that's dumb.
Not really XD
Yep, it is.
Uploading youtube video is working again!
Can you make it to where we can upload video files?
Pls
Sorry as of right now we dont have enough resources to actually host uploaded video...as it can slow down the site. Definitely in the future if possible.
Hi everyone,
It comes to our attention that the upload youtube video does not work on emowire at this time. We are working to fix the problem. The annoucement will be made in this forum once the problem is fixed. Sorry about it guys!
Hi everyone,
Emowire's server is being scheduled for update on 4/20/15 between 1:00AM and 2:00AM CST. You may not have access to the site for about 10-60 minutes.
Sorry everyone. We have disabled the chat box temporarily as it might have consumed much of the server resources and slowed down the site. You can still contact your friends using Private Message system on the site. You can also visit the public chatroom as well. Sorry for about this.
It's quite upsetting though.
What is this public chatroom you speak of, all I see is blank unless I have the person as a friend...
Emowire wasn't like that before...
Thanks for posting this as many members are not familar with CSS :-)
it's no problem i know i was clueless when i first joined so i had to make my own judgements on what sites were safe and would work effectively (:i hope this helps them
Thanks this really helped a lot. :3
CSS video tutorial here is the link for the video tutorial i did i hope it helps those that didn't understand

omg thank you i posted a pic a while back asking for someone to help me put it in css my old account dont ask how but i got a deadpool gif from the game to repeat in the background but i swear i did the same things this time witha diffrent gif and it didnt work so thank you
i did it omg thank you so much *hugs everyone * yay markiplier with fish teehee
Gaaah thanks so much for this! It really helped ^-^
I am still so very confused, I guess I will have to figure it out
Thank you for trying to help new/frequent users. c;
Omg this helped me sooooooooooo much
I just used basic HTML. It worked for me. Rofl.
Where did the instant messaging feature go? Could you, the admins, possibly bring it back?
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
I have alot of requests but no way to accept them
but just ask him if you need help
I hope your problem have been solved.
If you're on mobile then go to the bottom of the page and select "Full Site" and wait for it to load and you'll see a red "Notification" tab, select it and then go to " View All Updates" and accept any friend request!
I keep trying to send messages to people and it won't work cause it says I'm not filling out the "Send to" section and I'm typing the person's username correctly am I doing the wrong way or do they have to be on the friend list first or something else?
Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
DamienAnderson said: Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
+Or in your inbox, click on Compose message then type the user name of the one you want to send message to and the rest is obvious !
But what if there isnt the''send message''thing under their profiles?
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
i have the same problem,but the''send message''thing isnt there.
mine keeps saying that i need to add a persons name i did that but it says that theirs no one of that name
i wrote a lot but w.e
I second all of this, especially chat. I'd love to have an instant messaging feature where you could have your own group chats, and even different (and maybe custom) chat rooms would be great.
just make emowire exactly like oldschool myspace hahahhaha thatd be the best
Add video chat too
I will personally delete the account and ban the account. Please send me screen shots of the conversation to me in private message.
How do I delete my account?
post pictures of penis getting punctured with needles
go into settings.
why delete?
Alright, so, everytime I got to hit "accept friend request", I get this text here. I know you can still visit people's profile,andaccept there, but it's a bit annoying. Especially when you have to accept a lot of requests at once. It's easier just to click the "accept" button, and continue on. Once again, I know I'm not the only person with this issue, since I think I've seen a few posts about it.
I don't get friend requests so I can't relate
It's a issue for example everyone I do believe. There's a lot of things that need fixed but just don't seem to get done. Kinda feels like they just don't care about the site much or fix ongoing bugs...
Thank you SuicideSheep for reporting the this bug to us. The problem has been fixed.
Thank you!
I would like a better chat room on here, with pannel and shit and room to private chat and stuff and shit
What does that have to do with this?
nothing :( I'm just asking stuff
Lmao that was hilarious
was to lazy to make a new thread so I just starting talking in this one
Lol the way she responded was gold
Problem fixed so topic closed guys :-)
Sounds great.
Something we have to reconsider. Maybe Soundcloud embedment or something in that sense

This is what happens everytime I try to view any profile, and from what I understand, I'm not the only one with the issue.
you need to click on Updates and that shows you the profile
^...no, updates only shows your notifications. She says she has visited other profiles and they all had nothing on them. 

              This post was edited by SoleilDormant at June 6, 2016 2:16 PM EDT
Vampire is right click on "updates" and it will solve your problem not the updates that is in red when you get notif but the "updates" next to friends, albums and other shit.
Thank you for reporting. It's fixed now.
Thank you.
is there a way to tag people on here
No. This isn't facebook.
lol haha thought that too
Yeah we dont have that feature
okay thx ^^
Hello very sorry to bother you all but I have a quick question regarding Group membership requests. Is there any way possible the site could automatically delete, deleted members' membership requests? I have atleast 2 or 3 and its making it harder to get to approving others since its in the way and everytime I go to reject it to get rid of it I get an error code.
So I heard there was a store on here... How do I get there?
I wonder the same thing everyday... XD
i contacted Emowire & asked them.. hope for a reply soon enough
What up wabbit
No not me though
Are you gonna ask the Truth about this? I'm sure that he can help with this problem
It worked out after I shifted to firefox from Chromium.
I'm guessing that this is a little late, but Emowire glitches on everything except Firefox for me anymore. It used to work on all, but not anymore. Maybe that's what happened to yours?
Have you tried to block that member?
He can't view my profile page anymore so yes He was blocked earlier today right before I took a break from this site
Great...topic closed
This site should also be app for androids and iphones
Sorry but there is no roadmap for app. We are trying to make the site accessible by everyone and this site also have the mobile version of itself
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
You have to be friends with someone in order to send message
From what I remember, they're not allowed. She has multiple nude photos but I doubt they are her own pictures.
Have you tried to unfriend and block that person before posting in this forum?
Topic closed
I just updated my status only for the text to copy 4 times over, like really? Idk if anyone has experianced this apart from me. Anybody have a clue?
The chat feature is working properly. It's because people dont go to chatroom; most members still preffer private messaging of the site.
Ok, thanks Monster.
that don't happen to me
Happened to me. Had an account for almost a year and BAM! Gone. Now everyone I remember being on the site, is now gone also. No trace of them. Sooo I have a feeling the site was hacked. Or the staff decided too many people had abandoned their accounts and reset everything. :(
The site has crashed in March of 2015 so any accounts that were there prior to March of 2015 were lost and unable to restore.
What the fuck has happened, was the whole website just reset or something?
Seems like it. o3oOr it could possibly be that someone tried to, or, rather successfully DDoS'ed or Dox'ed the website or something.
I have no fricking idea T_T Lost my last account and everything on it.... That really sucks... Is there anyone you can talk to or something about this so called '' reset ''
I know the feels. e.eBut I doubt it. Seems like they were highly unprepared and didn't even have a back up of all the data. Perhaps if they did the account information and whatnot would have been saved but seeing as everyone had to start fresh, nope.
I doubt speaking to any staff or moderators would help either. s:
Well maybe they learned from the mistake and will be prepared this time.
Hopefully. xP
no, what happened was the Emowire server crashed yesterday morning and they lost all of the data associated with it and were unable to recover any of it. So now, they're building the site back from scratch. Trust me, I logged on yesterday morning and it said "Gateway failed" or something. I checked back in several hours and they said they were down for maintenance.
Wouldn't they have had everything backed up for a site like this incase something like this happened.
Not really. I mean if they did, that's a LOT of data to back up (probably 2 PB or more). Plus it would take a lot of time to do so.
I wonder what they do to make sure this doesn't happen again because they can't back it up or it would take a long time they need some kind of plan.
Yeah they do. I mean, backing it up locally would take an EXTREME amount of time. I mean think of it: Pictures, videos, posts, anything posted on this site would take a long time. Like I said, it's like 2PB or more and that's a LOT of data
True hopefully it doesn't happen anytime soon I do not feel like making another new account.
Dude me neither I had quite a few friends on there and now they're gone :/
Same man I had friends pictures and quiz stuff I was quiet annoyed hopefully there won't be a repeat
I hope not either man. :/ I really hope not
WeLL SHIT,I had to remake my account and it looks like the groups and photos, videos,and such have crashed.This is terrible :C
wait, some dick fuck crashed the site?
They fuckin better not or else.
@spicewoodsprings, yes indeed some person did. It sucks I know :c .@SarahNafage, I can't see it happening, at least anytime recently. Now the developpers are aware and perhaps are more secure to it. :) . It's not an easy task to defend stuff like that. I mean, prime example, Lizard Squad tooken down PSN and Xbox Live for the longest time. :$
True.
Anyways, I just rebooted my group on here so im happy.
I certainly hope we wont be cut off from some of our friends for long.
@Nickasaur, how do you know these things, and do you know if any of our old accounts will be restored?
This isn't the first time the site has crashed... Being here for about 4 years.. This is the 2nd time I've seen emowire crash... The first time I lost over 100 poems I had written on the blogs... I wrote them there for safe keeping... Boy could I ever have been more wrong...
Wow that really sucks tbh :/ :/ I wonder why they'd do that? Probably a prank or something.
I sure hope not.
What the fuck has happened, was the whole website just reset or something?
Seems like it. o3oOr it could possibly be that someone tried to, or, rather successfully DDoS'ed or Dox'ed the website or something.
I have no fricking idea T_T Lost my last account and everything on it.... That really sucks... Is there anyone you can talk to or something about this so called '' reset ''
I know the feels. e.eBut I doubt it. Seems like they were highly unprepared and didn't even have a back up of all the data. Perhaps if they did the account information and whatnot would have been saved but seeing as everyone had to start fresh, nope.
I doubt speaking to any staff or moderators would help either. s:
Well maybe they learned from the mistake and will be prepared this time.
Hopefully. xP

ok this pisses me off so much that it crashed would have been nice to idk put an update on the login page saying hey site crashed all accounts lost so people at least knew
It's not a prank, it just happens sometimes when sites like this aren't prepared, thought they learned their lesson the last time but all we can do is hope they did this time, if not then maybe everyone try emailing support to update the site and protect it to prevent things like this from happening.
Well it is what it is. Can't do anything qabout it. Let's just move on and focus on brighter things
I'm not trying to be rude but people need to stop psoting up porn on here, it's gross! and everybody on here can see. I think somone needs to report it and get the person in trouble or maybe the owner who owns this site can get the person in trouble because porn is really sick and this is public just facebook posting up porn is not private and all of my friends can see it I did cover my eyes when saw the pic on this site and please whoever you are, please report the person who post up prn on this site get them in trouble and please tell the owner. maybe the owner will have a talk with them
There is a report button on said person's profile, and you report them for their content, unfriend, block, and proceed to carry on. It's just like cyberbullying, and it won't go away, but helpful tips are blocking people who post such content. :)
um nick? i just did reported the person but thanks for your help
Not a problem :)
I found all these updates really great, especially the chat feature! This makes everything easier for me, so thanks developers!What can I suggest? Poll/Quiz creations again! For sure! It was always fun seeing those around the site xD sometime people had good polls :)Keep up the good work :D
Hi Nickasaur,
Thanks for the feedback. We really appreciate positive feedback. I would love to bring back the quiz/poll feature but there are many members are abusing the feature and post meaningless quizzes and polls. Things such as "would you date me" or "am i beautiful" those things are useless to the system.
I don't know. I think those are those fun to take
It would be nice, if u could post a video again on ur status :3
when will emowire will stop crashing?
I couldnot og in to my acount so I had to make a new one :(
I have to agree with beautifulmonster that although the quizzes and polls were fun, most of them were used so people could stroke their own ego. If there was a way to filter that out, I think it'd be great to add them back again.
I think what Emowire can do is either delete any quizzes or polls that do not add content to the site such as mentioned by beautifulmonster. Or, have a content controlled, which means polls and quizzes will be created by only emowire then users can participate by taking the quiz or ranking the poll.
Although I love the editing that was done to the site since it was booted up again, there's one problem that carried over that I've always had a bit of an issue with. 

If you like someone's status or photo, you get a notification every time someone comments on it, which can be nice sometimes. If there was a way to disable that though, or be able to toggle the notifications on and off (similar to Facebook) it'd be awesome. I don't want to unlike someone's post just because of all the notifications in a never ending comment war.
omg yes
YES! THIS.
It drives me crazy.
Thanks for the suggestion! Definitely will put it in the future improvement list. Topic is closed for now :-)
Is the option to search members by state no longer a feature? I could have sworn that was there before the update this website has had.
We've just enabled it. Thanks for letting us know!
