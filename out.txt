That's harsh. Yeah same here. I had a girlfriend and she cheated on me thinking it was a game. The worst part is she posted pictures up with her significant other. What am I side line bitch? I dumped her instead and made her feel like shit. It's awful I know.
Many many times. So much so that I've quit dating altogether. Single life has it's advantages, I suppose. :3
Awe you poor man TheLotusEater. You need a faithful woman. ;~; I would probably quit too. So many stitches in my heart from feeling pain. Who would want to hurt such a sweet guy like you?
Yeah I've been cheated on entirely too much -___- people these days can't keep it in their pants.
Umm...does my 19th birthday counts?  So i walked back into living room and well there was my love (now my ex ofc) making out with a girl and a guy at the same time haha -ok i feelt miserable - "Happy birthday to me !" I dont celebrate birthdays since then...o.o And one other time with that same guy ..he told me he needs me dont want to lose me,that he cares blah blah blah (things i dont believe anymore if anyone tells me)..20 mins later HES NAKED and drunk into bathtub WITH 2 NAKED girls....
oommggg i was with a guy for 3 whole fuckin years only to find out that he had been cheating on me LOTS of times, lying and ughh. he broke my heart and then acts like its my fault somehow x3 ahaha like what even??? .
Kassidy poor you, I understand that, like I was with my ex for 3 years to...like breaking up and making up and again and again....like....now i dont even know why i forgave him all that shit he did to me....like....like i was blind....blinded by love...ughh....I could have died for him...but he...well..he...he in the end was the one who killed me...

Lol that's true Alexa. I've honestly had way worse luck with girls than I have with guys.
And I think the lessons they give us are important. It takes heartbreak to stop blindly wearing your heart on your sleeve. and it makes us stronger people.

Loneliness is a better company. You girls are very brave. ;~; It makes me want to beat the crap out of the assholes who hurt you. As for you TheLotusEater, It was just a guess. I'm trying to be nice. xD Make friends not enemies. You look very friendly everyone does to me. Am I to assume you're dick? Nah I highly doubt it although you can prove me wrong.
twice in an entire two year engagement, and yes it took me a bit to fully find out but when I did I broke it off
Cheating = most of my relationships.
Was in a relationship with many girls and they all end with her being unfaithful and somehow making it my fault. Even walking in on her fucking my best friend I've known for years which ended up in a lost love and a lost friend that to this day says it's my fault.
I've been cheated on many times actually. Once I walked in on one of my friends making out with my boyfriend ( ex ). And i couldn't stop crying since we had been together for 2 months. Sometimes I just wonder if something better is being planed for me or I'm not meant to be with anyone.
Yup many tears were had and revenge was always on my mind, but nope I was too pussy to do it
Been in a few relationships, estimate 10, and 8 out of 10 times I was cheated on, but I just got into a relationship recently and she is loyal, so basically it's 8/11.
should be hands up , if you havnt been cheated on..
How about, have any of you ever cheated on someone?
nope. never. i was loyal down to the bloody end. ugh. sometimes i wish i could give that bitch a taste of his own medicine .
go kassidy haha
Nope i am a strange older daft loyal prick
No I dont think it would be fair to give someone the same pain I went through the irony is too much :/

No....I haven't been in a relationship because of these types of insecurities. I just want a nice relationship with a guy that will hold me in his arms till dawn and someone I can be sure won't leave me because of stupid reasons....Someone I can love with my whole heart and care for.
@aunryse thats cause you are decent
I feel like most people have. Not a very fun experience. But you live and learn.
very true indeed
Literally every relationship I've ever been in tbh....
my ex boyfriend cheated on me a few times and never told me, i only found out because he left his facebook messages open last sunday.
I hate that crap. I hate finding out AFTER. Especially if they're the one that dumped you.
I was just in a relationship not so long ago she was nice until she stab my back literally thn left me , she took everything I had even my heart and then she crushed it                       

Luckily, no. Or rather, I don't think so.BUT! My ex boyfriend already had a girlfriend when I asked him out. We had been together for three years until I found out and broke up with him. It was the hardest time I had in a while. It broke me and prevented me from trusting anybody. I am in a relationship now, but it took me months to actually accept him properly (I've been friends with him for 3 years).
yeah it was a pretty messed up situation .__. and aww thank you
I've never actually been cheated on since i rarely date but sometimes i overthink so much at night i think i drive myself insane and make myself believe they cheat on me,
Actually no, if you find people who love you and who tell you every day that they love you and make sure you know it, then they usually won't do that stuff. Surround yourself with people who don't like hurting people and you usually won't get hurt. That's my best advice.
Like 90% of my exes have cheated on me.
Like every ex ive ever had has cheated on me except one. but i fucked that realationship up big time :( real love is hard to find lol
Gave up trusting because always cheated on and lied to wether relationship is long or short tried dating a friend I cared about accidentally stumbled onto posts of her with her ex fiance turned out was two timed whole time....lesson learnt right? Later on tried dating a friend who drove me to trusting again finally....again stumbled onto posts on her social media as well with pics even with her ex fiance..... I never cheated once and stayed honest but always comes out the same  like my hearts the canvas for liars to make their bruises then failed suicide attempts and more scars teach you that you can always trust yourself failing or not you always have you
I was with this one guy for a while he made me so happy and always made my day but one day he started to act weird and abusive later that week I found out that cheated on me for a month I was heartnroke

Hellloooooo everyone. These are the words of wisdom from REB.This page explains the various things in the world that annoy the SHIT outa me. God i just LOVE freedom of speech. Keep in mind that these are just my point of views, and may or may not reflect on anyone else. I do swear a lot on this page. so fuck off if your a pussy who cant handle a little god damn bad language. heeeheee. And now to get started:---------------------------------------------------YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When im walking around in a mall and there is this SLOW AS SHIT person walking in front of me!! Goddamnit im trying to get somewhere! So move it or loose it BITCHES!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When there is a group of assholes standing in the middle of a hallway or walkway, and they are just STANDING there and talking and blocking my fucking way!! Get the fuck outa the way or ill bring a friggin sawed-off shotgun to your house and blow your snotty ass head off! YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When people dont watch where THEY ARE FUCKING GOING! Then they plow into me and say "oops, sorry." or "watch it!" NNNYAAAA!!! Next time that happens i will rip out 2 of your damn ribs and shove em into your fuckin eye balls!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---When some rich ass stuck up piece of shit white trash person gets in a car wreck with their brand new car! YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---When some stupid ass kid blows his fucking hand off because he couldnt figure out that a lit fuse means that the firecracker is going to go off soon!! HAHAHA!DUMBASS!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---OOOOOOOOJAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!! GOD I FUCKING HATE THAT WORTHLESS TRIAL!!Who in their right feeeeearrrRIGIN mind would care about that trial??!? its not any different from any other murder trial! Tell those fucking reporters to get a life! And what the fuck do we have to gain by watching that stupid trial anyway? Its not news! its a trial! not news!trail!trialX=Xnews!YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE!!?---Jon binay however the fuck you spell her spoiled ass name Ramsee!!! We dont care! Good fucking riddens!! What the fuck do you expect if you fucking put your kid in all these beauty pagents when shes 4 years old!! SLUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!! I bet her damn dad did it. Fuckin perrrv.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---STUPID PEOPLE!! Why must so many people be so stupid!?YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Making fun of stupid people doing stupid things! Like one time when i was watching this freshman try to get on a computer that needed a password....he typed in the password........and waited. The retard didnt press enter or anything. He just waited. Then he started cussing at the computer saying it was screwed up. Then the freshman went and got a teacher and the fucking teacher could not figure out why it wasnt going anywhere!!! JESUS!! Personaly i think they should be shot.YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Natural SELECTION!!!!! God damn its the best thing that ever happened to the Earth. Getting rid of all the stupid and weak orginisms........but its allnatural! YES!I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom, no more dumbasses. heh.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---ASSHOLES THAT CUT!!!! Why the fuck cant you wait like every other human on earth does. if you cut, you are the following: Stuck up, self centered, selfish, lazy, impatient, rude, and......damn i ran out. anyway. Every fucking line i get into i end up having to wait a fucking hour when there WAS only me and 1 other person in the line!Then the queer sucking asshole lets all his/her so called friends cut in behind em! If that happens 1 more time i will have to start referring to the Anarchists cookbook (bomb section).YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!!?---LIARS!!! OH GAWWWWWWD I HATE LIARS. And living in this fucking neighborhood there is thousands of them!! Why the fuck must people lie so damn much! Especially about stupid things! Like "Yeah, I just bought 5 cases of M-80's in Oklahoma for about $5. And they are legal there and everything. Yeah my parents buy most of my guns, every once in a while ill use my 4,000 dollar paycheck and buy a shotgun or 2. And my brand new hummer just broke down on the highway when i was going 250mph. Stupid cars." like that, now, what fucking part if any would a norman human being believe? And thats just one person!! Another BIG example is Brooks Brown(# removed for privacy's sake). Now, according to him, he has a 215 IQ, 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in Florida), 95mph fast ball(he is only 16), runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to.....Theee Button..., his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sang "r.e.s.p.e.c.t." and the lead singer of Aerosmith. And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents give..GIVE...him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations. Again, according to Brook Brown. OK, when people lie like that, its not impressive, noone believes it, it sounds just plain stupid, and its a fuckin waste of my time.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---R rated movies on CABLE! My DOG can do a better damn editing job than those dumbshits!! For the sake of all television they can atleast try to make it sound like actual words the person would say! If you have ever seen Aliens or Predator youll know what im talking about.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---Windows Keys!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---WAREZ!! Why pay when its free? YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who think they can forecast the weather!! Then they think that everyone else will think that they are cool just because you said that we were gonna have a 4 foot blizzard starting today! like just the other day, this punk i know was saying.."Yeah tomorrow we are gonna get like, 2 feet of snow in just a few hours. They were saying its gonna be the biggest snow in ten years. Yeah itll be about -60 outside too." And that day we get an inch of snow and its 26 out. I feel like getting a baseball bat, breaking it over his head, and then STABBING him with the broken end!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---Country music!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---Zippo lighters!!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who say that wrestling is real! now, im talking about the matches like hulk hogan or undertaker. If you think that these matches arent fakes and that these guys are REALLY punching and breaking arms, then please email me. I would love to know where you live so i can BOMB your fucking house and ACTUALLY BREAK YOUR ARMS!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---YOUNG SMOKERS!they think they are so god damn cool with their big bad ciggarettes and their "sooo cool" attitude. I cant wait until they are about 25 and have they have to breathe through their fucking necks and talk with a computer hooked up to their X-vocal cords.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---PAYING FOR MY CAR INSURANCE!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---Freedom of the press. I hate that part of the Bill of Rights.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who are against the death penelty!!! i think the courts should fuckin fry convicts even if all they did was unarmed robbery!YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!?---SCHOOL!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---SCHOOLWORK!YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!?---COMMERCIALS!! OH GAWWD I HATE COMMERCIALS!!! The only ones i MIGHT like are previews and some car commercials. But jesus christ, all those Lotion, PERFUME, Makeup, JCPENNYS, Jostins, food, coffee, or advertisement commercials! Please! Destroy them all! never record another! They suck! They are only funny the first time! Think up other stuff! They suck! They are stupid! We get sick of them VERY FAST! VERY! VERY FAST!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who dont believe in personal hygiene. For the love of god, and for the sake of god, CLEAN UP! Fucking people with 2 inch fingernails and a whole fucking pot full of dirt under them and raggy ass hair or shirts stained to hell. Or people that just plain stink, and they dont do anything about it. Now, im not making fun of anyone if they cant help it, or afford it or anything like that, thats not their fault, but if your some kid drivin a ford explorer and have yellow teeth, then thats just plain unhuman.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who use the same word over and over plain! Like, "actually", or "fuck you", or "bitch". Read a fuckin book or two, increase your vo-cab-u-lary ya fucking idiots.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---People who try to impress me by TRYING to brag about the militaries weapons! Now, to some of you this might seem, wierd, but its happened. Like this, "dude, they just came out with this new chemical that can destroy denver only by using a cubic inch of it. The military is keeping it all locked up because if it gets to close to water it explode, and the force would create a cresent earth, maaan." Yeah, right, bullshit, or like this, "Dude, the air force has tracked santa clause for like, 10 years now, and he is a real man. its all a cover up." or "The air force just made a plane that can bend light man, its completely invisible." now, this is just some of the shit i've heard. it makes me SICK. And they arent even in the fucking military nore do they know anyone that is!YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE!!?---People who THINK they are martial arts experts! They are all cocky and thinkin that they are all big and bad, saying bullshit like, "yeah if you snap your fingers right here the sound waves will melt the brain and youll die rom your own brain poring out your ears." or "if you flick someone right here their arteries will burst and they will drown in their own blood." fuckin hate it when they keep saying "your own", like it would be someone elses!?!? then when these shitheads get in real fights the get their fuckin asses wooped all over the place by some little girl.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---STARWARS FANS!!! GET A FRIKIN LIFE YOU BORING DICKHEADS!YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!---RACISM!!Anyone who belives that blacks, asians, mexicans, or people from any other country or race besides white-american....people who think that should be drug out into the street, have their arms ripped off, be burnt suht at the stumps, then have every person of the race that YOU hate come out and beat the shit out of you. and if you are female, then you should be raped by a male from the race you hate and be forced to raise the child! You people are the scum of society and arent worth a damn piece of worm shit. You all are trash. And dont let me catch you making fun of someone just because they are a different color because i will come in and break your fucking legs with a plastic spoon. i dont care how long it takes! and thats both legs mind you.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!?---THOSE FUCKING ADVERTISING OR CHARITY CALLS! People saying "Hi, im not selling anything but". good, now shut the fuck up and go get a real job!"well! you are so rude!" damn strait bitch and if you dont get off my line ill come down to your building and shove that phone list up your ass and take the phone and shove it up your bosses ass! "click" heeeheeee, i love that.YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!?---When people mispronounce words!and they dont even know it to, like ofTen, or acrosT, or eXspreso, pacific (specific), or 2 pAck, learn to speak correctly you morons.Thats all for now folks, hope you enjoyed! If i think up any more things, ill put em on here!And sorry if i offended you, but, if i did, that means that you are one of the people that i mentioned that i hate, so i guess im not sorry, you asshole.---------------------------------------------------Best viewed with Netscape 3.0+.

Making this post so people with different sexualities can meet! I'm straight:)
im catsexual
Bisexual!!
Pansexual
what is techsexual?
People who are sexually turned on by tech. That's my guess.
oh. thats a new one. at least to me lol
I've only met 2 or 3 people who claim to be techsexual. I guess an android (not the phone) would be what they're looking for, too bad they don't exist, and are usually evil in movies and TV shows, or just emotionless.
And then there's me the gay guy looking for his dark knight in skinny jeans and band tees
i straight and im also looking for that guy haha.
I need an American who likes my bands xD
I'm American and I like bands xD
inbox me :)
I'm a trans girl and I'm pansexual ^~^

paaaaanshmexual o3o

I'm Bisexual and prefer girls to guys. I generally like girls emo or not. But I only seem to be attracted to emo guys. unfortunately there are not many emo girls that are bisexual lor lesbian or near my age of 14 so forever alone XD

Hey everybody! I'm bisexual and currently forever alone, R.I.P :'3
I'm kinda new here. I've been a member for about a month and have only visited twice, I'm mostly on Facebook or Messenger. If you want to message me, my name is Dami Adams, user is Dami.reaper. 

There's not a lot that you NEED to know about me. I'm pretty easygoing. I like writing stories, poems, and songs, reading, or listening to music in my free time. I listen to everything and I read a lot of horror. Horror movies also get me going, 

I'm single, but I'm only here to make friends. I don't really care for relationships. I prefer  to be single and just flirt around honestly. I don't have the time or patience for failed relationships. 

I want to become a writer someday and travel the world. Other than that, I want to start my own family. 

You know a bit about me now, so just shoot me a message I guess. Don't be boring and don't be cliche. Peace xx
I feel you on the realationship stuff. Flirting is way to fun to quit. Not that anybody flirts with me.

Hello cx
Oh hi my name is Shane from Texas. I have joined this site cause I'm very lonely and need a friend in my life. I am 17 years old and my favorite bands are Fall Out Boy, Sleeping with Sirens, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots, Blood On The Dance Floor, and of course Black Veil Brides the band that saved my life :D lol.
No wonder you're lonely, your tastes in music are shit and you say "Rawr" spontaneously.
Oh wow that exactly the opposite I wanted out of this, good job you just added another cut. And Black Veil Brides got me to wear I am today and has taught me a lot and made me consider not suicide
You needed Black Veil Brides to get you out of suicide? That's fucking pathetic, man.
This isn't how I wanted it to be at all, you guys are really triggering me
Also if you talk about Blood on the Dancefloor on this site, don't get offended when I tell you about all the horrible shit Dahvie Vanity's done. Calling him out is something I love to do, mostly because he's not in jail yet. It's a shame to still be a BOTDF fan at 17, honestly. 

Im 18 from Indiana. Im just looking for some cool friends to gain!
Or, Bullet, just listen to some fucking Brand X.
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
Hi BlackBlade ^_^ Hope you're doing well :3
Look at this garbage. THIS is what you are supporting. This is the man you call your hero. I need to you think real hard about what it is you see in him.



Don't tell me how to live my life faggots. Dahvie is a great inspiring guy
Nothing about him is inspiring, he's a bully. But hey, don't say I didn't warn you when you're at a BOTDF meet & greet, being forced to give Dahvie head in the back of their tour bus.
"better person" This person is calling me a faggot for being honest and caring about them lol they're not a "better person"
Look ,I know what he called you but you really can't change his opinion.I'm not taking any sides but ...how can I say this? That's his opinion and we can't make him replace it with ours if he doesn't want to.
I really am trying to think of things about Dahvie that might be positive; but it's clear that the only reason emo and scene kids like the guy is because he defends them and says it's okay to be "different". Then to the people who aren't "different" and call him out on his bullshit? "I would love to push you down the stairs you cunt brick!". So inspirational right?

It's not ,I know.I've discovered Dahvie and BOTDF when I was 15-16.I know that he isn't a sensitive person and I know that he's rude towards people.
I agree that few of the songs that he has are pretty funny but if I have to fully agree on something with Shane is about Black Veil Brides because Andy really is an ispiration.At least that's my opinion.
I personally like their music, not a big fan of them. But who cares, becuase its all about the music so everyone shush 
What kind of films do you like?^-^
I like sci-if to ^-^
Hello :33

Hi :3
Hai cx, How are you doing?
What's up?
Uh, hello..
Hello
Hey! I am new to Emo Wire. I simple adore metal and rock and obviously, BLACK. I am an introvert but I am free online :P I have no piercings or tatoos. And mostly! I LOVE ANDY BIERSACK 
ugg's make me wet.
Hello
I'm very bored and new to the site. I want to make friends and not many people are accepting my friend request, I want to find someone to talk to (: i'm very friendly and easy to talk to so please dont be afraid to chat with me.
Hi gaynigga :D
hello :D
bro go sip lean
i bet thatll help
Hey there peoples. Name's Jack and I mostly came here to read any interesting perspectives. Being an introvert my whole life has led me down a relatively strange path. Everyday filled with self-analysis, my view of our reality has gotten to a point where I'm not sure if it can change anymore. So I plan to pan through and see if I find any interesting minds. 

Hello :3
Hello. You're a pretty attractive fellow.
Hi there Nimda, lol and thanks Soleil.
hey my name is james im new on here looking for any single emo or non-emo girls would want to talk to me. 

Heyo! My name is Caitlyn (feel free to give me a nickname if you want xD), I just joined and I'd love to talk to some cool people! :3
I think I'm cool :D so what's up?
Haha hey! ^_^ I'm doing good, just mentally preparing myself for school tomorrow. What'd up with you?
Hello :3
Hey! :3
Just finding awesome people like you to chat with!
Haha sounds fun :P
Hi my name is Jess and I'm new to this website, and would love to make some friends. Sooo just comment heh c: 

Hello! =3
Nimda said:
Hello! =3
Fuck off filthy nigger
hey therand welcome
hi :D
Hey I'm Brandy! Nice to meet you! I'm looking for friends and people to chat with. I love anime and uh... horror stuff I guess.
You show no dominance, what a faggot.
I'm not a pile of sticks, thank you very much. But yes, I am gay. Thank you for pointing that out. Have a wondrful day!
Pans tho...pussy.
Did I say you had a pussy? No, I called you one. Stop trying to act smart when your shit doesn't even make sense. Another "unsure" 18 year old. Faggot is a durragatory term towards people like you. You act stupid, I'll treat you like you are. Fuck outta here.
That's not very nice nor mature. And I will not. You do not control me. I control myself. I am a boxer. I take care of myself. Now please leave me alone, sir.
How is it less mature than acting like an idiotic child? Who cares if you're a boxer? Isn't that a poor white man's sport? And taking care of yourself by losing fights and getting your ass kicked...right. VERY smart. Also, your sentence structure in itself tells me you don't take care of your mental health. I'm not controlling you, I'm treating you a certain way. So, maybe think a little next time, big man.
I do have schizophrenia and autism, my good sir. I don't get my ass kicked because I don't do competion. I only fight if I have to protect myself. So please stop treating me the way yoy do because it's not very mature or affective, as it does not make me concerned. I reported and blocked you. Please leave me alone now, because I have more improtant buiseness that talking with an imature brat like you.
Autism is obvious, your intense paranoia shows you're more unstable. Hope the Psych ward is having a sale, bc bitches like you needa be put away or put down. You aren't really a boxer if all you do is "fight". Do you hit with your wrist? Like normal kids with autism do? Autism doesn't compensate for your poor english. How am i being immature? I'm just being honest, pal.

This isn't you dude. Back off,
I remember when it was against the site rules to use photos of other members.
well it's a picture I've found out on google
Not yours though. It's on Google because the original owner of the photo uses Instagram, photos from Instagram and or MySpace are shared on Google as well, so of course you will find it there.
it's actually a very old picture that is on internet so stop making a whole bunch of unnecessary drama about it, there is no owner of that picture since it's unrightful from google
Dude just go. This isn't you. Give it up.
Pictures shared on Instagram are leaked to Google, your lies fall on def ears.
never said it was me I just thought I liked the picture on google that's all xD
I don't think it's his picture either lol it was an old thing that is on google
anyho if he's really mad about it he can send me a memo we'll solve that in a civilized manner
ohh well from the site I picked it I think it was posted 2 years ago but I don't have the memory of numbers so idk it's just an approximation.
and if it's really really really his picture well I'm going to switch my picture for Ron Jeremy. I think you guys should relax and take a deep breath I think you just took the thing a bit too seriously.
if I'm breaking the site rules then he is too mostly xD
Nope, just you.
then you are also breaking the rule
We've had some ass on here faking well known members and it's been kind of irritating. So you stop saying to relax and just change the damn picture, and this will be done.                      

Lmao. I took this picture when I was in turkey. I bought this Nirvana shirt and these shoes there. I took this picture in October it can't be 2 Years old. 
Stop using it.

Now Jamie,what the fuck!?I mean who's next!?Please may this crap not happen?STOP USING PICS OF OTHERS!
I'm not using another members photo, dumbass, therefor, I'm not breaking the rules.
but you aren't the artist who painted this picture so it is not your propriety
You got the rules all wrong, just stop.
well it's a random picture on internet no one propriety... YOU got the rules all wrong just stop
You're an idiot. If you have a problem with the rules of this site then go complain to one of the admins, they will just tell you the same thing pretty much.

Hey Sophia
Hello people. I'm Toni. I'm 18. I am looking for some friends. I had an account before and deleted it.
Get to know me. (:
Kik : misaki.Senpai
Snapchat: paleghostbitch
If you add me on either, you have to tell me who you are and how you got my username. (for snapchat you must send a picture with your first and last name.)
Instagram: paleghostbitch
Tumblr: xpaleghostbitchx.tumblr.com
Facebook: search 'azu nyan'
Vampire freaks: paleghostbitch

That's all (:
Welcome back.
You look extremely familiar and I have no idea why. lol.
I used to have an account as "necromancermango" i think i deleted it but idk. I wasnt very active haha
hm. I might have just saw you then haha
Haha probably. I promise I'm not fake. I can even skype anyone that thinks so.
Thats funny actually. That was one of the first things I thought. Usually overly cute people are fake. But nah. I believe you =].
AW YOU THINK IM CUTE THATS SO SWEET. Ive never been faked actually. Haha.
I just want advice. Cause whenever I block someone they can still message me and shit
If you block someone they cannot message you. That would ruin the whole point of blocking you dense motherfucker. You click the block button and the person cannot see your profile, add you (which they HAVE to do to send you messages, only your friends can do that), or see your posts. You're obviously not blocking anyone.
Weird, maybe my computer is just glitchy af
Making your profile private isn't blocking. Or, ya know, you're just a fraud because if you're not friends with said troll they can't message you, period.
I think I understand what the problem was, it would take a bit to explain and i'm tired so l8r
Okay I'm gonna block you and then you come here and try to type something i need to test my theory
Think I found what's wrong with your computer http://blasze.tk/PN2FRD
Blocked people can still post on your forum threads mofo.
o
If you're the troll's second account, I have your IP address ;)
I'm not don't worry. The guy's name was Hugh mungus on here or some shit
No shit? Trolls here have made two accounts before. One to troll and one to pretend to be trolled. What you said on this thread and you making this thread to begin with doesn't add up unless you're trying to get us to acknowledge the troll. Ergo, you could be the same person.
"it kills my candy emo buzz"? Come on, man.
I'm a candy emo.
Probably haven't figured it out but that's not my real name.
looks like someone here is trying way too hard to look unique.
"candy emo" or me because my fake online name is Laurasia?
My only concern here is, as a Nunmoose, I don't appreciate that people take pride in their mental disorder and try to pass it off as "I'm unique and have [madeup "gender" identity]. It's extremely unhealthy. I can only hope that Miranda seeks the mental help she so desperately needs.
I'm not even? Go bother an actual sjw about that. I'm the gender I was born as. Not giving a shit what people want to be doesn't make me part of that group.
XD WTF, ok first of all it tends to be a waste of time trying to change someone's mind with your unorthodox methods , when their minds are made up, i used to think that i was half spider because i was bitten by one and thought it was the kind that bit peter parker, and noone could change my mind , second of all , if gender is decided through x and y chromosomes , then what do you call someone who is born with an x chromosome and two more broken x chromosomes and one y chromosome , and is born with absolutely no body private parts or anything that may differenciate a masculine or feminine look?, and third of all who the hell is miranda?

true but since they are neither boy nor girl and they are still people, they have the right to choose a different choice , and my point with the spide thing was that noone coul change my mind , only i could, also i didnt say you insinuated the chromosome thing, i was just using how gender is scientificly specified
and either way , what you say is toxic to the young mind , is just reality, people like different stuff, i have a friend who looks and talks like the spitting image of steriotypicle hawiian surfer dude who is SO into porn that he has multiple memberships rings condums to school everyday, and even plans on becoming a porn star once he is old enough XD, its just the human mind and it wants what it wants even if its bad
boi that was the shittiest ddlg blog i have ever seen.
Yes, they can choose, they choose between the binary male and female, but please show me any store or bathroom with "agender" on it. What is toxic to the young mind is feminist and liberal propaganda. I don't give a fuck about anyone's kinks, what I do give a fuck about is vulnerable and mentally ill children trying to push themselves into 18+ BDSM circles with no concept of what kinks actually are or know of the potential dangers of people in BDSM circles and which safety precautions they should take. So many infanticized 15 year olds go on tumblr claiming to be a "little girl" not knowing what they are getting into. As for chromosomes determining gender, you were entirely irrelevant to the thread at the time I even said that. I was telling BulletForMySilentSuicide/SoleilDormant that she need not insuate that I believe there are more than two genders, because she assumed the person making the callout post for trolls was my f4ther and I. You were strawmanning that my argument was specifically "if gender is decided through x and y chromosomes", when I said no such thing.
I have no idea who LeftAndGone is and I am not getting involved with you and hughmunguses mental shits
funny, we know it's you. you had the same profile pic as your current profile before you changed your name on it.
LUL @ LAURASIA (TAKEN FROM UR FACEBOOK THAT UR MUM COMMENTS ON)
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE HAX AT DARK BOI? GET YOUR BLACK HAT FAGGOT SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU IRRELEVANT PIECE OF SHIT. KILL YOURSELF (((((((:
those "XD" emoticons only show how braindead you are, seek medical asistance as soon as possible.
yay more entertainment, watcha gonna say next O.O
My F4ther Cohort is not irrelevant, I enjoy his humor very much, and don't ever insult him by even coming close to suggesting that he'd ever be friendly to a democrat. You seem to have a double standard here, you say he's so much of a no life that he cares about the size and color of font, but I do the exact same thing. Do you always insult yourself for the sake of an internet battle? Do you per chance want to visit my Summer Kampf? I'm sure you'll qualify. 

i also highly recommend you to drink gene pool purifier, it will help this planet if you do it.
you actually took time to look up what i was talking about? that and the fact you said "us" and how you always seem to find which account is his is starting to make me think that your the same person, also hacking is not as simple as opening a command prompt and putting in some random things, being a black hat means i hack to my own personal gain , if i take 12 hours out of my life just to ruin an internet trolls life , then im hacking to my own dispense and either way i wasnt even the one who brought up that im a blackhat , he just scrolled through my bio just so he could try to use something against me, and last of all what do you mean meme , ive read through my comment five times and have yet to see what your talking about
not a pool that you piss and swim in, a gene pool. drinking some gene pool purifier would provide a healthier more clean gene pool if you drink it.
*expense* fuck
alright you got me on that one
i wasnt really attacking you, im just interested in the way you think , so im making conversation, and no i dont have some problem against having friends, im just aware that if you were the same person, then thats the ind of stuff you would be doing, also i never said that someone was wrong for mentioning i was a blackhat , and i run with the bullshit windows 10, where i cant even find microsoft word without out googling, its even on a handmedown computer that cant last 5mins off the charger so yeah it would take around twelve hours, also im not a self proclaimed blackhat , my dad when he was still a cop yold me what i was doing was "blackhatting" and that if i didnt stop that i would be "in a grave, under a bridge, or in jail" , so i googled it and found out i fit the description
How is insulting my F4ther, a man who I view dearly, going to get you closer to observing the way I think? We do this because we find it enjoyable. If you're interested in the way I think you clearly find me intriguing and enigmatic enough to devote time, why assume I would make such a rookie mistake and slip up on the pronoun game? I am very much capable of speaking in the singular first person. That story was so much bullshit I actually think you may have surpassed the buffalo in the midwest as the leading emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Great dad you have there, I'm glad that's past tense, because I wouldn't want an asshole so blinded by familial ties that he doesn't arrest his son for breaking the law. You were told what you're doing is illegal (yet you say you have respect for the law), you were told the dangers of something you didn't even know had a name, yet you say "yeah I'll totally give myself that moniker." What? 

Your dad must be so proud when you DDoS kids off xbox live when they're better than you. For real kid, it's funny you think that's my real IP too...who the fuck is Jacki? Please hit me back after you can build some shells to shake my server. Now go back to 000webhosting to log IP's with your fake links. Fucking Skids.
;-; why no replying ?
soooo. i like this boyyy.. we've being sitting at lunch the last few days together i give him stuff i make him laugh.. but i tink i might be too emo for him & idk how to tell him i like him.. what if he rejects me or never talks to me again!!! wtf should i do?
fuck people we are all the same nobody is above anyone, just stay your sweet self dear
Theres a girl at my school that likes me. Ppl know that she likes me. She knows that ik that she likes me. But no one knows i like her too. One day she tried talking to me at lunch & i was really really really quiet to her cuz im socially awkward & too nervous to talk to her. She probably thinks im not interested in her but i dont want her to think that. Im just to nervous to talk to her. Idk wat to do pls help me
listen here you fucking pussy. girls don't like weak men who can't even talk to a girl they like, grow some fucking balls, walk up to her in the hallway or in the lunchroom or wherever and be like "hi, let me get your number".it's 2016 and there are still pussies everywhere.
I have tried talking to her a few times so dont call me a fucking pussy
you're still a fucking pussy for not asking her number. you know that she likes you, everyone knows that, so what would you lose you fucking moron?
I would definitely try to ask her that if there wasnt a good chance she doesn't like me anymore
quit being a little bitch and do it. man the fuck up.
Ok
Ok thanks
Yeah, just be yourself, it helps a lot.
Dude just give her a cute note
You'll be getting laid for sure
Thank me later
"send nudes" should be on the note.
worst advice given.
Not really. When it comes to relationships and stuff like that, being yourself helps a whole damn lot,
I love that picture xD
asking her out while being yourself does put you at massive risk.
Ok
Don't listen to Aryan, he is just some weeb who thinks he is cool. You need to be yourself or there is a chance that you could be known as a "fake dick" and then you would be bullied to death for lying
you call me a weeb yet you're the one with the anime profile pic. if you didn't know i am cool as shit, so get your facts straight. you're making it seem like if you ask a girl out the most straight forward way possible you will be known as a "fake dick", oh and being bullied to dead that is highly unlikely, use your head dumbass.
You can be bullied to the point of suicide and you literally photoshopped an anime thing into your profile photo.
miranda we know who you are, there is no point of making fake accounts.
I remade my account from the constant fucking bullying because of something so stupid.
or you can grow up and realize that hey, if you're being bullied online then you're totally not supposed to be on the internet. the reason for that is because you take everything close to your fat self. i have written a forum post on this and i will link it here. i also would want to quote tyler, the creator with a extremely important quote "hahahahahahaha how the fuck is cyber bullying real hahahahaha nigga walk away from the screen like nigga close your eyes haha".http://emowire.com/forums/topic/8853/most-effective-tactic-to-combat-cyber-bullying

Yall aren't here to fight. If yall r gonna fight, at least do it somewhere else
nigga we can fight anywhere we want.
When I was smaller something happened an I can't tell my parents cus I'm embarrassed an it haunts me an I remember it is hate it I do an I want to end it all but when I try all I see are my parents so I can't bring my self to do it but I tryed everything to help numb it but it's only temporary an only makes me hurt more it's gotten so bad I stop talking to my friends and I even left school cus I feel like everyone knows I tryed to runway to somewhere no one knows me but I was found an it only made things worse my brother see an sister hate me cus they don't know an I'm just don't i have tryed so much that I feel like if I don't try one more time I'm just gunna pull the trigger to end it all I do is sit in my room all day an smoke to help forget but I still remember all of it an I just want it to stop please help
if you don't tell what this event you're embarrased about in forums then you're just wasting time.
Ok but I'm not telling anyone I haven't told anyone an I don't want to
Aryan is right we can't really help you if you don't tell us what happend. If no one knows then there's really no way of stopping it unless you try to push it away and move on from the past or at least getting some help or telling someone you trust!
It easy to say
It's not
An to admit it happen idk
It happen when I was little  an kept happening till I was 9 but why did it happen to me why not some one else
From a distance, your icon looks like a really hairy vagina
mate, it's pretty easy. a few years ago i used to wrap myself in seran wrap and smear baby oil allower myself and fap to that. you see it's really easy especially because no one knows any personal information or even what you look like so it's not even embarrasing to say that because no one knows who you really are (unlike my situation).
Yea but that's different
it's different because you have no personal information about yourself on your page and most importantly you have no pictures of yourself on this, so it's only in your favor.
No because it's not about me fapping it 
I wish that would be less embarrassing
Fine but don't make fun of me frs
because you know everyone will know who you are and all of that.
Whay do you mean?
What*
Oh nah like you said no one knows me an I'm bouncing my ip so it's just I don't like admitting it
you do realize what i meant to say was that you're safe to say it due to the fact that no one on here know's your personal information so there is no point of hiding it.
It doesn't make it easier ton say
But I was sexual assaulted multiple times by my dads cusin an my mom's brother so many times an last time I saw my dads cusin it all came out an I started to beat him till he was unconscious an they asked if just left an my mom's brother always bring it up I hate it but I can't do anything cus he is always has a knife I hate it cus I always see em both
Your family sounds super fucked up...
No my dads side isn't only him an mom side it's all fucked up they are either in prison or crazy house or on so much pills that they're dumb
I don't want to be here anymore I want to end someone help cus I'm tired of it if I can't get help fuck it there's always the permanent way to end it

Suicide eliminates the chance of anything getting better.
Well fuck it I don't want to be in family anymore I hate being looked down on cus I know they know something but not what happen an they make me feel stupid cus I hated going to school so I stopped at 6th grade an I hate how they bring up the pasted an how I was bullied an they do it to make me mad an it makes me look worst an I hate feeling like shit cus they use to jump me my cusins an my lil brother would get me when I was younger an I hate it but they think I'm making it up what happened an the think I'm doing it for attention one time I had everything planned out had the gun an was ready to pull it but all I saw was my dad an only my dad missing me but he was the only that cared how can I leave him when all I wantted was to leave them can't do that but know I'm questioning that
Sometime I think I should have done it
killing/torturing them would avenge your destroyed childhood
What no I never said that
I really want help can you give me advice or something cus I'm so close to the edge an I dont want to keep goin
A social worker might be a phone call away
My brother burps very loud and I have a burning desire to beat him at his own game and burp into eternity. How do I achieve this level of mastery?
I am really lonely without having any friends in the real world.... I would like to have some real friends that I can have daily conversations with, talk with about my problems and having someone who understand me....
Same
Im pretty lonely irl & online. 
I only have like 2 friends & i don't get to see either of them irl
I'm sure you'll find some freinds in real life it's not that hard. Though I know how sometimes it can be :l But I'm sure you'll find some real friends and even on this website!
Hi! I'm Kiki! Please to meet ya!!!!!!

You either keep trying or you just move on with life until you find someone again or someone finds you

You either die on the tracks or live long enough to become a train....
I work with trains nigga
Okay that part about becoming a train is an amazing idea xD 

Ywah it would bit I don't want to be that big lol
It's not about fiding someone else.
You'll never be happy with anybody until you can be alone, by yourself and be content.
I do!
Hello I'm an emo italian girl and I'm about to cut my skin again, I haven't friends because I'm shy and people is so bully with me, I have so many problems with my mother too so I feel so alone and sad. I have this heavy on my heart and the pain is so strong that I cut myself all the times. :( I'm so sad and I don't find a solution :( I will never be happy. :(
I have the same exact problems (mother issues and cutting). Let's be friends? c:
Yes
Hi guys...um same issues as you..feel free to include me in this friendship..haha
I also cut myself cuz it helps me somehow to forget about this f*****g life.I haven't friends but when they need my help then i have milion of them then i just say:''F**k ya,always when u need my help u suddenly become my friend''.(Add me if u want.) 

i don't self harm and i never have done but if you guys need anyone to talk to or just someone to listen to you then i gladly will :)
im sorry im the same way too but my parents are just idiots do they even know who i am no they dont i want to kill them or me! ahhh help me
i cuted my hand yesterday so i didn't felled that hurt
oh man that sucks
oh man that sucks
oh man that sucks
never cut myself ever because i find that it doest help. talking with people and finding people who will love and support you is the only cure. if you want, you can talk to me about your problems!

I've been there, it hurts and it can feel like it will never get better. But it will, maybe not today or tomorrow but it will. There are people here who obviously want to help.
I cut too, and i found that squeezing an ice cube works just as well, without blood.
Never in ANY way harm yourself. That means hurtful words towards yourself, cutting, burning, bruising, and more. Don't do it; self harm at the begining may seem like hope and like it's your friend, but it isn't. Self harm makes you believe that it is the only option, but really, it isn't. Talk to a teacher that you like about your problems, it helped me when I had a friend who was down. They have no choice but to listen, and they will get you neccessary help.
I for one have to say that it is awfully scary to get help. I have to agree with Alana if you want help you look for it but, I have to say that teachers freak out. They make it a big thing and make you feel like a freak it causes the issue to flame up awfully but sometimes you have to take these risks if you are endangering your own life. I for one sucked it up and I learned to deal with my issues and for me the best way is to help people who have the same issues I can't completly explain how it works but it helps to know that you tried to help someone from making the same mistakes that you made. I know life is hard and death is easy but in the end we are rewarded with so many painful memories but so many beautiful people that you just haven't met yet. Anyone can die. Yet not anyone can just live we are survivors in a ring that has no god and no devil. We are in a sea of darkness and we are drowning some of us have given up but before you do there is someone who dives in for you and pulls you up on their ship. They give you a choice to either take you back to the land of the living or to sail with them to find others who are drowning so you can stop them from becoming a part of the dark sea we call depression.
Man for those who said they self harm I'm sorry for all of you. Nobody deserves that kind of pain. you guys endure enough to make yourselves want to cut then you guys ruin a perfectly good body maybe even a healthy body(I say maybe cause idk all of you) but its all right. If you need a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk too I'm always here
hey. i used to self harm. very badly. and at times i feel like going back to it. it was a very dark time in my life. but i got through it. and i can help each and every one of you. anyone who self harms can add me for a little support and help. and we can be each others support group. Ok? OK! haha. add me people! :3
wanna know what you can do? man the fuck up and stop being such a little pussy bitch.
About to cut my flesh open... Someone please talk me out of this.
You could use something that won't kill you, like small burns or rubber band smacks, cutting is dangerous

Is it me or cutting is so addicting? But I just can't stop no matter how hard I try
You're just pathetic.
Haha really? Thanks for the Advice . 
I don't think I am because 
1-I stop a year ago i have thoughts of doing it but I start doing something else so I won't be tempted but just wanted to see what people would say. 
2-don't freaking judge me you don't know what ive been through . If you were in my shoes you would already be dead. 
3- this website is for helping not shooting people down. 
4- I did nothing to you to say something like that at all.
The sheer fact that you'd be tempted to cut if you weren't doing something else is quite pathetic. The fact that you cut in the first place is just sad.
It's is sad, i would   admit that, but what really matters most is I haven't done in a year and I'm trying, and everyday I'm getting better, my life isn't easy you know l.
What's so GOD-AWFUL about your life, then?
It's pretty long, you sure you wanna know?
It's pretty long, you sure you wanna know?
Jesus fucking Christ, yes. Get on with it.
Ok ok, hold your horses. Okay do you know what it's like to never have a family always wishing you were dead the family always beating you do you know what it's like to be raped by someone when you only 11 years old and watch someone commit suicide in front of you and you cannot stop it  and being in so many foster homes being bullied at school and say that you're ugly that people hated you and nobody loves you I felt so alone for so long I shut off my feelings so I couldn't feel so cutting was the only way i know that I was somehow alive. There's more but I don't feel like saying it,  I was told I was never by my family and all the family's I've been with I was an unwanted child . That why people told me no wonder why your parents in Cambodia didn't  wanted you,  you were useless.

Learn english.
Hey  now don't be rude
Hey now don't be a guilt-tripping little shit.
Haha you're so funny you asked for it tho.
Yeah, sure, but you could have said "I was X, Y happened to me, etc", not "Do you know what it's like to be X? For Y to Z you all day".
Nah, it's not as meaningful. Sorry I'm a poet. Gotta let people relate to me.
So basically you're attention whoring?
Haha no no no, I hate attention it scares me. When i write I want people to know I understand their pain, so I just some how write like that.
That's right,  but knowing more pain  then others I still can relate but there is always someone out there hurting more then me. So they can relate when I write about my pain.
You don't get my point... You're implying they don't know more pain than you, that you're more important than them. Hardly relatable, is it?
Well it seems I put it that way, but no I'm not saying that. I just write because I want to it helps me and if it helps others I'm really happy. I love helping other people
Sure.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's supposed to mean "sure".
Ok I know that. Well  I do. K so we should be friends
Okay then.
Yeah!! After all this I thought we  became such goods friends

Damn Ik how you feel and I'm sorry
I know a lot of people either say "then do it" or go along with a whole bullshit story of how everyone will miss you and kill themselves. But serously, don't let others tell you a bunch of crap thats only going to make you feel worse. I know you posted this message looking for someones help but none of these people will really understand, because they don't know you. You need to find exactly what helps you cope, wether it be taking it out on inanimate objects or actually going to a therapist or someone you trust. If this doesnt help, dont keep looking on here for some one to help, because i guess nothing will. Have a great day and dont do anything youll regret later.
Question is asked in the title. I'm going to ignore for now but they'll probably comment on this so whatever.
Grow some thick skin, don't be retarded, be smart, be able to defend yourself.
How about you stop bullying me when I have no line of defense since i'm brand new to this site? Also i'm not retarded, I have the IQ of 138. That's smarter than the average person. I'm legally a genius in my country. So stop, leave me the fuck alone, and shut your stupid ass mouth.
You don't, you wait till middle school ends and ignore them. If they're still bullies in high school it means they won't be successful.
I'm in collage
And i'm still bullied, especially on social media
No way you can be in college when you can't even spell it right.
But thank you for the advice
Sorry I have mental disabilites. Please ignore my terrible spelling.
If your IQ were 138, you wouldn't be an oversensitive flower. Probably wouldn't be on this site either.
I am in college though. I'm a freshman at CNM
So do I. Tourette syndrome and ADHD, diagnosed when I was seven. Doesn't stop me from ignoring bullies.
Excuse me? So you're going to be an imature jackass as well? Thank you, you are making my day SO much better
I try to ignore them but they are persisant, especially on social media
I only joined this site because of a friend. It was a mistake to think I could try to make friends anywhere
Line of defenses can be built now. Also, what skitzo and autist is like this? You seem pretty desperate when you start pulling out that IQ score. lmfao.
That IQ doesn't help with your spelling ig...
You're just an insecure bitch.
How am I insecure? I'm telling you how it is. I'm actually quite happy with myself.
Not if you're bullying me
How is being honest being a bully? I think if anyone is insecure, it's you.
If you get affected by "cyberbullying" it's because you walk right into conflict. If someone calls you a stupid poopyhead pr whatever, block them and forget about it. By replying you only invite more. If you were so smart you'd be aware of this shit.

^my internet is shitty ignore the double post
Academics? So why can you not spell properly with that high school education?
Because i'm bad at spelling. It's my weakpoint. Everyone has them, including you.
Fuck em is what I say and I want to warn you that almost all of the popular users on this site are rude as fuck. But don't let that bother you, it's just words. I don't know why they have to say that shit but eh. Just find the people worth staying for even if it's a famous person or something. I'll be you're friend haha
Tell me what my weakpoint is. Also, spelling and grammar are somewhat a BIG deal. Defineefine a weakpoint. Like the ones you have by showing your insecurity and failure to live up to that "high IQ".
Thank you! You seem friendly! First person to act nice towards me. DustMoon089
Exploit for "DustMoon" is that she goes on sites like this to find an "emo dude". I mean if you can find a weak point in me, great.
Your weak ponit is that you realize others are kinder than you so you bring them down.
Not really, I don't envy kindness. If you're smart, you'd know that no country has gotten anywhere by being "kind". So if you like being a weak little prick, great. If not, I suggest you get mean and honest.
I'm not like you. I'm kind, smart, honest, and helpful most of the time. Instead of bullying other people I take the time to compliment and care for others. I believe peace is the ultimate good, and that of every leader that has conquested over another country was a complete enemy to society, like you. I will ask again for you to please leave me alone and respect my opinion, as I respect yours.
I don't ask for you to respect my opinion. If you lead people by being a fairy, you will fail. What peace treaty has worked? Yeah, we may care for others but overall, why? Why not just provide? Look at Putin and Hitler. They have total control and have/had others by the balls. Peace may seem nice but it's a shit idea. Kindness is a vulnerability, I notice it and act upon it. Simple.
Half of my family was killed by Hitler. I do not mention him.
Well, that just shows you aren't meant to lead or anything. You're weak, and links that are weak break. So you should maybe not try to act like a leader when you can't even valid point and also refuse to mention a God-like leader such as Hitler.
You're a terroist aren't you? I see it now. You've nothing better to do than hate on other people and kill others for your own satifaction.
So I kill people now? A terrorist does it mainly with motives such as religion, political views or anything that relates to social aspects in life. I just am honest and giving a valid argument. If you see me on T.V beheading Christians or shooting up nighclubs, you can win. As of right now though, I'm just a guy telling you how it is.
I didn't mean it in a literal form. It's an expression of speech.
Pretty radical figure of speech there, bud. Also, it isn't really hate towards you, you are too irrelevant to be "hated on". I guess I'm a terrorist though. And by definition,"a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims". Am I terrorizing anyone? Granted I have political aims but am I physically threatening or terrorizing you? If I am, please tell me how, I'd love to know.
You're harrasing me for trying to make friends. You are "terrorizing" me by using methods that are unjust by using words. I have asked you to leave me alone. I don't like you nor want to talk to a bitch like you who thinks harrassing other people is fun to do in their spare time.
Don't bring me into this rude bullshit anymore, it's not funny dude.
And yes, I want an emo dude lofl.
Don't bring me into this rude bullshit anymore, it's not funny dude.
And yes, I want an emo dude lofl.
You brought yourself into this. Nobody needed you, and you involved yourself. It's funny because you play victim like you probably play on emo dudes dicks.
Leave her alone you jerkwad.
Oh no! Whatever will I do? The fairy called me a "jerkwad"!! Will I ever recover? Yeah, I will. Get over yourself you ignorant autistic cunt.
I am a fairy. You're a demon from hell.
I can live with that, because at least I can fend for myself with good comebacks.
At least I don't harrass other for entertainment
It's honesty, not harassment. Also, I can spell better than you, so I think I win this fight already.
I don't see this as a win or lose thing. Nothing ws gained accept hate. That's not something to celebrate. That's something to fear, bucause it brings sorrow and grief.
Fine. Then you FAILED at the english language, you FAILED to prove anything valid. What you fail to realize is that the more you reply, the more vulnerability you show. Hate brings war, with war you get success. You can be hated or feared, but that builds character. The problem with you is you don't learn from mistakes you've made on this thread. You don't try to improve your spelling or improve anything in general. You FAILED. It shows what little worth you have.
You have little worth for not being kind to a new person. You failed in being a decent human being.
Why should I be nice to you? Because you're new? Does that grant you immunity to honesty? Hm, that seems a little sad. That just because you're a new kid, means I should instantly respect you. Makes no sense.
No, it means you should treat me like a human being instead of a punching bag
^that being said, I guess that means I am worthless, because I didn't immediatly respect. lmfao.
You choose to be a punching bag. You're a boxer, don't you swing back?
I'm a human being, but I don't expect immediate respect just because I can't fend for myself and I'm a pussy.
Respect and honesty should come first when meeting a new person. It shows kindness and willingness to understand another human being other than yourself
You lack that, which shows inhumanity
So selfishness is inhumane? Right, because I'm sure your parents got to where they are by being generous. Yeah maybe they kissed ass, but you get money by being selfish, you are successful by being an asshole, being selfish. Your "respect and honesty" shit is a standard. I don't have to bend to your standards. Plus, I am being honest. You're the one getting upset. If anything you're inhumane because you're lying when you say I'm inhumane, because I just proved you wrong in this paragraph.

There is a drug i take that helps me, it's called fuckitall.
since ever internet became a thing that belongs in every household arrived a terrible and devastating term called "cyberbullying" the phrase was coined after people started calling the action of writing insulting messages, and humiliation on the internet. As of the late 2000's individuals spent years upon years of useless research to combat this epedemic, but i have found the most effective way to do that and i will share you this extremely effective tactic that everyone overlooks, here i go.the first and most effective thing to start off with is to realize that when you're on the internet with no social media or any information about you on any website you are completely anonymous meaning that you are literally a entity, but when you decide to show your fat face on the internet you are putting yourself at risk of people writing offensive things to you, so again you have to be careful and know the risks.now, pretend some random person starts insulting you there are many things you can do, crying about it and screaming "there is a guy that called me a hunchback of notre dame" is the worst thing you can do, instead take this situation in a more mature manner, utilize all the features of the website and use them all for this. you can block the person, delete the comment, or be actually mature and ignore it, or even better laugh it off don't take it close to your heart like you take everything into your fat porkhole.i hope that this helps everyone who reads this and didn't know about this, go kill yourself you fucking horse face looking communist thunder ass pubic chode scroungy cock sucking pussy eating nasty greaseball vagabba the slut looking coon with too much makeup.sincerely, friedhelm

"I'm afraid about telling my parents I'm emo". It's not like you're coming out as gay. Like for fucks sake. The fuck you got to sad abt anyway you're 11. Go fly a kite or sommen. Like I said before, grow balls and get out of ur MCR Papa Roach phase (((((((((:
Holy fucking shit you fucking people need to get a goddamn grip on yourselves. I'm here to jerk off and watch porn where bored Russian women pretend to have non-consensual sex, not read the blisteringly stupid whining of a gaggle of retards with mile-wide delusions of persecution.
Here's an idea, OP, you fucking walking turd, you vaguely human-shaped pile of afterbirth, why don't you post some content so I can bust my nut and get back to my miserable existence instead of bitching when a) you clearly have no idea what's going on and b) figuratively has nothing to do with you?
Christ what a bunch of fucking crybabies, what a boring, pathetic group of shitheads. The one upside about having to read this stupid shit over and over and over (and over and over...) again is I really do end up feeling better about myself. I may be a loser, but at least I'm not at the point in my life where I actually believe some mythical SJW is going to somehow stop me from masturbating.

Want help? Think before u act, kiddo. lol. No one on this site wants to help an 11 year old who doesn't understand what a phase is and sounds like he just came back from an English seminar. Grow up, and be urself (emo isn't urself).
OP post is sad. Makes me sad. Girls wear make up because of unfair social standards forcing narcissistic tendencies down their throats to the point where it's considered acceptable, so much so, that women hold women to higher standards then men. And they do so with much more brutal punishments for deviance from materialism and surface beauty. ( I personally would submit my opinion, that this is due to a sense of shame that they carry for themselves that they don't measure up the standard either.) All the while men sit back and appreciate the work their forefathers helped put in place by objectification and sexism. ( coupled with this, I also believe that women have a desire more so then men, to be loved, led and cherished. And to get that, some will give way to the lust of men, the void of the latter, makes lust appear as a substitute for the qualities they seek. ) Men lie for plenty of reasons, and I cannot pretend to know all of them. That said, I would argue, I think shame, and fear, are the essential motivators. ( shame still roots in fear.) Men are charged with the responsibility of doing what's right for the person they claim they love. Is lying, to protect yourself, falling within the bounds of her best interest? Questions that we all need to ask ourselves. The reason I found this post sad, is that it accepts dysfunctionality, and stereotypes genders into something wrong, and pain inducing. It speaks of the creator accepting brokenness in a relationship, as if they have never felt what real love and responsibility feels like, on either end. ( I personally would suspect a female artist ) it is sad because this person could have so much more... And they settle for the lies installed into them by society. That men have to lie to protect themselves, and that women have to be something more than they are ( and thus lose themselves) to be an acceptable* suitor. You can disagree with me, that's ok. These are my thoughts and opinions, and thus the reasoning behind why this post makes my heart lurch in protest to this artists ( as I ) perceived, beliefs.

the entire thing here reeks of troll from f4ther and gabehorns side. f4ther acts exactly the same as cassettes (perhaps its him who knows)
BUT yeah i agree with raeanna and to be emo can also be a start for a lifestyle in just an alternative direction (goth for example i even have friends who used to be emo and became skins) and the keywords for being alternative is -to not care what others believe or say about ya-
It's a sunday if you didnt notice, a day of relaxation to do whatever. I spend it on forums and playing games. otherwise i work during the week and on Saturdays if they need me in the office. you on the other hand are calling me out for just being on this site, which you are probably on every day all day because you have no life or job. At least i know what fucking day of the week it is you smelly weeb. Days of the week actually matter to people with responsibilities and jobs. lolololol Telling me to get a life on my only day off. That's great. Now Run along and fold your laundry your mom washed for you. also nice job at saying anything intellectual to retort to what the convo was initially about. you are quite the debater there mr high IQ
OKAY. im sorry im not worth your time mr. fabulous life who's only day of is on a sunday, but if this site is for little nobodies like me and my friends then why are you on it? why would you take time out of your "only day off" to argue with ppl that arent "worth" your time? if all you can do in your free time is mess with ppl younger than you then appently your the one who doesnt have a life :/ and i dont know about everyone else but im 13, i dont have a job or need one, so and most likely neither does alot of ppl here, so go fuck off to someone who gives a shit :D
It's a meme u dip
It's best not to give them any attention RaeAnna I mean that's what every troll wants trust me I know! x3Jaden smith....
XD okie fine w/ me lmao
He did not delete his account, you fuckers reported him.
Who is this f4ther? Like he seems like an asshole. I hate him already...
LOL "these days", "kids", 11 year olds think they're so high and mighty now days. "I'm so different and smart bc i see the world for wut it truly is"...no pal...you don't. Climb a tree ffs.
ok but do u not understand that u are a target on the internet when u are at such a young age? you may think predators are as easy as "bad person do bad things so block them" but predators can be anyone. you should not be on the internet at 11, you should be riding bikes and coming back inside when the street lights come on.
It is not a sexual orientation, faggot. Grow some balls.

Want help? Think before u act, kiddo. lol. No one on this site wants to help an 11 year old who doesn't understand what a phase is and sounds like he just came back from an English seminar. Grow up, and be urself (emo isn't urself).
OP post is sad. Makes me sad. Girls wear make up because of unfair social standards forcing narcissistic tendencies down their throats to the point where it's considered acceptable, so much so, that women hold women to higher standards then men. And they do so with much more brutal punishments for deviance from materialism and surface beauty. ( I personally would submit my opinion, that this is due to a sense of shame that they carry for themselves that they don't measure up the standard either.) All the while men sit back and appreciate the work their forefathers helped put in place by objectification and sexism. ( coupled with this, I also believe that women have a desire more so then men, to be loved, led and cherished. And to get that, some will give way to the lust of men, the void of the latter, makes lust appear as a substitute for the qualities they seek. ) Men lie for plenty of reasons, and I cannot pretend to know all of them. That said, I would argue, I think shame, and fear, are the essential motivators. ( shame still roots in fear.) Men are charged with the responsibility of doing what's right for the person they claim they love. Is lying, to protect yourself, falling within the bounds of her best interest? Questions that we all need to ask ourselves. The reason I found this post sad, is that it accepts dysfunctionality, and stereotypes genders into something wrong, and pain inducing. It speaks of the creator accepting brokenness in a relationship, as if they have never felt what real love and responsibility feels like, on either end. ( I personally would suspect a female artist ) it is sad because this person could have so much more... And they settle for the lies installed into them by society. That men have to lie to protect themselves, and that women have to be something more than they are ( and thus lose themselves) to be an acceptable* suitor. You can disagree with me, that's ok.

gotta agree with gabehorn here i must say, predators prowls on these kinds of sites like mosquitos with malaria infests somalian villages
my girlfriend frequently gets "modeling" offers and that they represent som modeling agency, that is how they try to get the girls atleast
and they target these kinds of sites first n foremost

Maybe consider this??

Funny how this girl deletes her comments showing how shes all for this 11 year old. Then when everyones opinion went in the direction of "you shouldn't be on here", her tone and purpose changes to that. Shallow...
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF RAEANNA
D: i really have no idea what you just said. and im not saying he should not be on here im saying that he needs to be careful! gosh if i didnt think he should really be on here i would report him, but its his choice and unlike all of yall i havent told him he neeeds to get off. im just simply saying that its dangerous. :L and there is nothing wrong with standing up for someone, thats not shallow.... 

It's shallow that you change your standing on a situation as soon as it goes against your original opinion. Also you deleted your comments so you're also a big ol pussy.
i did not delect them, my friend did, she cares for me and doesnt think i should be talking to you, and honestly i dont blame her and i dont care if you dont believe me or call me a pussy, call me all you want and reality check, i never changed my perspective, i told him to be careful because younger kids are the bigest targets.. i never went aginst him :( noicte how in these other ppls comments they are saying that he should leave im just trying to help, there is nothing wrong with trying to fucking help someone when other ppl are all agist them. 

Jesus lord you are stupid. That's not my opinion that is a fact. A serious fact. My prescription is ritalin and chemo.
i am sorry if you cant see this, but you are wrong.. you might wanna delet that. it kinda makes you look stupid :P and i could almost swear your the new account of f4ther. its bugging the crap out of meh XD lol the funny thing is that...
Jesus lord you are stupid. That's not my opinion that is a fact. A serious fact. My prescription is ritalin and chemo.
is suppose to be offensive?? but really im lmao because no matter wat i say you are just gonna keep coming back even though you know your wrong. so i guess i am just wasting my time, but thats okay cause i dont mind wasting time for something i believe in :D
YOUR grammar and spelling is enough to show how stupid you are. Go back to year 6 stupid twat. It was SUPPOSED to be offensive. Also, if you still use "Meh" you're childish af. Maybe go back and get an education rather than getting on forums and probably only giving the S U C C to guys over 18 willingly.
im sorry you dont like the way i type. 1s thus beterXS lol and if you have noticed im 13, and yes im childish as fuck XD and i am one of the top students in my gradel and i have NEVER gotten an F,D or even a C in English/grammer since 2nd grade. hehe :D sooooooooooooooooooooooo anyways im not going to keep arguing so have a nice life :) (im not trying to be a smartass im trying to be polite)
Top of class in what? 7th grade? Nice, Pre Algebra and Literature Composition must be so very very rough. Get the fuck outta here. It's not "the way you type" lmfao. It's the failure to prove you have no grammatical skills.
yes 7th grade. and no its not rough when you know how to do it.. :/ and yes i do have grammatical skills but its my choice when i wanna use them, so i can talk, type " fail to prove i have grammatical skills" the way i want to. why do you have a problem with that? i dont question the way you use grammer? so get off my ass bout it okay?
Well, as long as you're ok with being an idiot and having double standards. Great. I hope you kill yourself soon enough. The world would be better off with less retards like you.
this is hot as fuck
yasss im fine with it. and oh shit hes back XD
Man, sooo many people 0_0
yes, there is alot of ppl -_-
I completely agree with you, but it's whore.
What pisses me off, is a stable relationship with someone, close and comfortable enough to, you know, take nudes and send them to your partner for THEIR eyes only, and after months, you guys seperate from a big fight, and then they post them, and then you're clarified as a slut.Rumours are a big thing too, I hate them. Then you're also known for "getting around" when you don't.But yeah, some people won't consider the lives it affects, and won't stop.These 2 things happened to me above, so. Yeah, really recommend being careful.
ha sorry autocorrect
@nickasuar yeah it is a terrible game
If someone sleeps around or is a whore its their business and their business only. I don't see what the big deal is. It affects no one else but themselves.
I never said I have something against them I said I hate how lightly the term is thrown around
im a whore as i am older, i couldnt give a shit
I never said that was bad guys..
True. Your statement had negative undertones is all.
Sorry for the confusion :/
Nah, its all good.
You are right though. That word is thrown around so much anymore by teenagers regardless of if they are sluts or not. You don't hear it as much the older you get.
You're correct :c 
In my school I'm literally known as the school slut. Yes, I'm a virgin..
But my ex-best friend spread a rumor around that I slept with the group of guys I hang out.
Whatever, the term slut was originally used for girls with messy rooms :b
i wouldnt worry about any of it. words only hurt if you let them.
Yeah just because someone calls you slut doesn't mean you are...Plus if someone called me a slut I would automatically get suspended for beating the shit out of someone but you know i'm only defending myself..I used to be the SLUT untill a real slut came into our school she slept with a teacher and the crossing guard she posted pictures of herself naked to many times and she started grabbing girls ass's and guy's dicks so yeah and I am a virgin this day and haven't touch dick ever and I was the slut!!!
Yeah deep thoughts by dezzielee.
souch a terrible game us humans play :3
Yeah I guess that's life and if it is life sucks ass but enough said from me...
It does.
And people wonder why you get so angry I get really angry when I try to ignore to hold stuff in store them away but when I burst with anger everyone tells me to calm down and I can't.
I understand that :/
thx for understanding I guess
np lol
@tears: I had a very similar thing happen to me in high school. It sucked. People are way too obsessed with other people's lives. It's pathetic.
you just have to draw a line in the sand and stay solid to whom you are. haters will hate. lovers will love. i kmow what tiype of person i am. same as bullys, stand firm. it shits them when you smile back and dnt get pushed around any more
There's no "right" way to use the words slut and whore, because neither of those things exist. There are people who have very active sex lives, and there are people who care too much about what other people do behind closed doors.
If its interfering with an already existing relationship, that's when its a problem. But even then, nobody is a "slut" or a "whore", they're just a fucking asshole.
Sleep with whoever you want, 1 person in a year, 20 in a month. Just be safe, and don't be an asshole.

Exactly
Here in the Britain (assuming most of you are probably american) 'sluts' and 'slags' are extremely common insults thrown at teenagers all over the place. They don't even think twice before they speak here, any insult will do for them. And that disgusts me.
im not too sure on how i would go about editing my page !!! ive made websites with html coding but im not sure how to work with this !!!
meat said:
html coding
CSS and HTML are mainly using codes so it sucks
Also, how do I know he actually likes me, and isn't just seeing me as a walking visa?
Follow your heart hun, no one can tell you better than you. Just do what you think is right. Maybe hint at it a little and if he doesn't like you move on
get to know him. often there is more behind those eyes. Plus if you think this way about this guy, it doesnt say a whole heap for the long term stability of the bf anyways
Talk to him be funny around him and talk alot it happened with me yesterday my bf now was a stranger now hes my bf just talk to him alot and  remember be fun not serous in everything ^.^
Lets talk about me for a second. My ex and we were together for 4 years. During those for years I've met many girls from work, outside of work etc...even they are hot and beautiful but I've never once I have a thought about "wanting a piece of that". Mainly because I was with my ex during that time. Even though they can be beatiful and hotter than my ex but I didn't see it that way. I was with my ex and I totally respect her and I wouldn't do anything to hurt her behind her back. I respect my relationship and my ex. The lust is just a moment and something it doesn't last. What really matter is appreaciate what you have. You have to question yourself of why? How would your bf feel about know this? If your feeling about your current bf has changed, I would suggest to talk with him and make your final decision.
Well I don't mind being Single and all but it just seeing couples and people being all boyfriend/girlfriend is really bumming me out a bit where I'm like " i wanna cuddle with a person like that too" or ," i wanna hold hands with a person like that too." something mushy like that but I'm like " being alone is good and plus i won't have a broken heart" Ive been loner in relationships also so techinicaly i never really expericence a real/good relationship soo i really don't know at all
I know how you feel and it sucks
yea it does but you learn to cope with it
I totally understand; being single means you get a whole lot more freedom and you aren't obligated to anyone. Both have their pros and cons, definitely. Don't be discouraged if you're single -- I am too! :/
yea they do have their pros and cons i agree on that
Honestly, being in a relationship is give and take. There is always a power struggle within a relationship, I've seen. If you're missing some aspects of being in a relationship, why don't you just get a FWB? You get the cuddling and other things. Just not the drama of a relationship.
I'd say everything hurts, both being single and in a relationship.
But I'm just a total pessimist so I see just the bad sides.
Eh? Getting dumped feels ah... depressing, but it'll make you stronger. Relationships are totally worth it. But you must be prepared for it. It's a responsibility.
Should i just wait till i cab find an emo girl to try to date cuz i put so much trust into girlz but they just break my heart i just want a girl who doesnt mind constant cuddling
Yeah dude wait it out. wait for the perfect fit for you. remember you get to choose this relative. :)
okayz tankz yew mate ^_^
Well i got guys that hurted me so right now im just going to live the single life till I found that guy that would actually treasure me
the single life isnt bad there is stuff you can do without worrying bout your luv holding you back but i understand seeing people being all lovey dovey and you just being left in the shadows it really does suk
yea i know what you mean i seen that alot where ever i go
No matter what,or where I am I always feel alone. It's a terrible feeling that I can't seem to get rid of. I just always have the feeling that everyone hates me and is just pretending to be my friend. I worry that my girlfriend is only with me because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings or something like that. I'm that type of person who can feel alone in a room full of people. I just feel like no one cares and that it wouldn't matter to anyone if I died tonight. Why do I feel like this?
You feel like this because your mind has tricked you into thinking no one cares. I've just met you, and I care about you. To help, go ask some people you somewhat know if they care about you...they most likely will say yes! Or ask a teacher, they will definatly say yes. Trust me, EVERYONE you know would be shocked if you were to go missing, or even die. No person has no one, there is always someone around the corner.
Depression. Depression makes you feel that nothing is ok, that your being bullied, that no one loves you, and that you are alone. But in reality everything is okay and nothing is ever as it seems. Reality hits you in a way that makes you feel hated but I swear to you that you're not.
As a former High school student and an expert at having this feeling Shayfoxx I can easily answer to you with pure honesty, that this feeling that you have will stay with you for almost all your life. I don't know you I havent seen how you act or how you speak or how you present yourself to your friends and family so all I can offer you is an honest response. You and I and so many others are always in a war with our minds. The mind is a truly powerful thing. It can trick you It can hurt you it is the translator to everything you feel hear see and smell. So imagine it like this your mind is in a state of mental abuse from either you or family. Your mind is a part of you and is not really your enemy it is yours and yours alone. But so many of us deal with this everyday and im sure many others have stated that you are not alone but i understand that you cant escape it. You can't escape it unless you fight back im not talking about drinking or having fun with your gf but to fight against that depression. Even if you get tired of it even if you feel that you cant deal with it keep pushing so you dont go down easily. You may believe that you are alone and naturally you want to be alone for some odd reason that you feel like no one will understand but believe me people do understand.
Well... I get that feeling too. But in my case it's rather that I feel locked up inside myself and Idk. I just feel far far away. The thing I did to make it better is attend a therapy (i'm still in it). It helped talking about it. I got a big group of firends. They are wonderful, but sadly I'm not that close to them as they are between them (bc of my "little problems"). I finally opened up to them, talked about my problems and everything. I wasn't really specific. But i it actually helped me a lot. I always say; a girlfriend/boyfriend is someone special, someone who you trust. You always want him/her to be open with you. To talk to you. I think your gf may have the feeling that she is losing you. And maybe you should try to talk to her. You could just... tell her that you feel like she doesn't love you and that she wants to leave you. Tell her that you are really sorry but that you have some troubles being open. You should really talk to the people around you about it, bc if you don't, then they won't be able to help you. If your gf was in the same situation as you are, you would like her to talk about it too, wouldn't you? Pls try to have a conversation about it (not a fight)
You feel lonely because honestly, your'e searching too hard. Seeking friendship or companionship is not the way to go. It's like people who seek love never find it, but only encounter it when they least expect it. You're a cute girl. You will find somone who you can share memories and ife changing experiences with. Just don't try, only just be the best you you can be.
In Dying Need Of Help.
Of Course I Am New To This Website And To Be honest I Like It
Because It Reminds Me Of The Old Myspace Before Tom Went Stupid And Started Updating The Damn Thing
Anyways......
I Am In Need Of Help On The Fact That I Need A Back Ground For My Profile And Nothing Seems To Work. I Have Tried Many Types Of Codes To Many Different Back Grounds That I Seem To Like And Nothing Workks
Can Someone Help Me On Where I Can Find A Back Ground That I Know The Codes Will Work Without Having To Get Upset Over Stupid Codes.....
Any Help Would Be Nice
Thanks To Anyone Who Replys
Today my mother said to me horrible things just because I use black lipstic and black clothes and I have an emo hair cut. She want that I change myself but I will never change because I'M EMO and she can't do it to me. I want to be myself not a doll of my mother. Help please!!!! I'm desperate!!!!
Just stay true to yourself she cant change who you are
Listen to me, if your mother does not appreciate you, then don't yearn for her approval.
I have the same problem. But my mother keeps putting religion in to "back her up"
Why religion? Was Jesus emo and that's why God killed him? XD If anyone uses religion as an excuse to change a human being, then they're ignorant as fuck.
Thank you all for the advices. Hugs :)
its just a little phase is all 
Be yourself !
This is sad, but you just have to handle the situation until you can live alone. I'm suffering from that myself. My parents won't chango. Hope your mother does... *hugs*
I know exactly what you are going through,hun. My mother is the same way. All I can stay is to be yourself,she doesn't have to accept it. Some people's minds aren't going to change anytime soon. Why does she get the right to judge her own daughter for expressing herself? Nobody knows you better than you know yourself. Keep being awesome.
No joke I've think we've literally all gone through this so you're not alone. But I've been into "alternative"  all my life but only got into it when i was 10/11 and I currently just turned 15 and my parents are only accepting it now so give it some time.
My entire family mocks me for being emo.
your parents are fools.
That's weird, my mum accepted me from day one. My dad didn't though, so I just ignored him, he'll get over it eventually.
Same :/
You live under their roof and have to tone it down until you hit 18.
You may not like it but unfortunately that's how it is xD
I don't believe in stereotypes but I was "Goth" at 14 and my parents were fine with it.
My dad just wouldn't allow black lipstick or dyed black hair.
Other then that - I was allowed fishnet, combat boots and basically. What I wanted.
Everyone has their own tastes and style and parents are just looking out for your own interest.
I know it doesn't seem like it at a young age, trust me. I fought with my parents tooth and nail.
Though now being 20. I actually see what they meant.
Just ask your parents what you can and cant wear/have and come to an agreement.
Cause you do have the right to dress how you want but till your an adult xD
They are allowed to say no lol

I guess they think like good family members should live as normal and modern as they can so they can't accept someone with unusual thoughts and look.i mean it's fine.u don't have to bother your self,they'll slowly give it up.like...when they can't fix it,they let go.so don't worry it'll be fine

Hahhaha XD
Today my mother said to me horrible things just because I use black lipstic and black clothes and I have an emo hair cut. She want that I change myself but I will never change because I'M EMO and she can't do it to me. I want to be myself not a doll of my mother. Help please!!!! I'm desperate!!!!
Just stay true to yourself she cant change who you are
Listen to me, if your mother does not appreciate you, then don't yearn for her approval.
I have the same problem. But my mother keeps putting religion in to "back her up"
Why religion? Was Jesus emo and that's why God killed him? XD If anyone uses religion as an excuse to change a human being, then they're ignorant as fuck.
Thank you all for the advices. Hugs :)
its just a little phase is all 
Be yourself !
This is sad, but you just have to handle the situation until you can live alone. I'm suffering from that myself. My parents won't chango. Hope your mother does... *hugs*

I've had an abusive dad for years. My mother disowned me so I'm stuck with him. I starve myself, cut, and i drink to get away from it all. Probably doesn't help that I pill pop either. I have heart problems and i want to die. Things just can't get easier for me and the bullies are getting worse. I just can't do it anymore....
Ik how that feels but like Alana said don't let him get to you. Call someone if you need to. Hell when I was being abused I just moved out and told my abuser fuck off. Hell if he don't let you and nobody can help I really hate to say it even if he's your dad hit him back. But use that as a last resort. Don't do it unless you have too. Ik its not the best advice but your dad is probably just a coward and can't take that your better than him(to me anyone who is abusive sucks ass) if you need anything hmu homie whoop whoop and much love to ya
I have never told anyone about this but now I'm coming out about this. I always have visions about me or loved ones getting killed. Is anyone else exeriencing this?
You're just edgy. Don't worry, though, it's just a phase, it'll pass
Because unwanted visions are what make you edgy.
Trust me dude its crazy but the weird thing is they end. I have the same thing but mainly I just see people I dislike getting murdered. Its not that weird but if you feel you need help get some dude it's ok

Sorry but why are you watching porn? You're a child.

REKTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Triggered much? I'm genuinely concerned as to why you'd watch porn, as your profile says you were born in 2003. Like damn. Would you get offended if someone told you not to cross the street when there's cars passing? I'm pathetic, but you're the one wasting your time on porno at 13?                      

I'm not trying to offend you, you're just getting unnecessarily offended, my guy.
This is basically the definition of "I'm different than others my age!!! I'm so mature!!!"
Get a joke? I don't watch porn. I was just pointing out how you repeatedly comment on anything I post like you have nothing to do. I'm not triggered, just annoyed. And no, I am not claiming I'm different from anyone my age or more mature than them. Thank you.
If the reason I comment is that I have nothing to do, then the reason you make these posts in the first place is that you have nothing to do.
Amputee porn... Seems legit :llll
Eye Color Spells

5 seconds in and some 48 gender fag is 1) still alive and 2) already blocking. You're 13 and have no idea what the fuck life is. you're just mad that your fire crotch cunt can't get anything but another fat taco to bump with you. I may say this a lot but this is very genuine when I tell your "male" faggot ass to kill yourself...please do it now. and at least you can creamate yourself because that fire on your head and pussy is burning you already. so...kill yourself. 14 years in and already not worth it JFC.
Who is it?
You, fucking cuck. Carrot top bitch. You literally are using an old photo. I understand you are stupid (because you think there are more than 2 genders) but I'm not you, and not stupid. You are so pathetic. Honestly, leave and never comeback. The DB shows you deleted your acc and made a new one 5 min later. so stfu you 14 year old twat.
Think ya have the wrong person m8. There are more than more than two genders. Girl, boy, both, neither. Easy.
Listen boy/girl I don't know who you are talking about and why you are so triggered by the fact that there are more than two genders but keep me out of it. I just found this website today and I would rather not get spammed with something I'm not even apart of. Byebye.
top ramen looking ass. there are only two genders, the rest is either mental disorder or wanting to look unique or both. you need some dr. paul r .mchugh in your life grow the fuck up and read some facts.
WHEN SHE TRIES SO FUCKIN HARD TO NOT BE HERSELF BUT WILL NOT ADMIT THERE IS ONLY 2 GENDERS. LMFAO THIS BITCH NEEDS TO KILL HERSELF. WHAT A WASTE OF LIFE LMFAO.
I'm just gonna go I have no clue what is happening, you have your own mental problems that you need to solve.
says the one who has gender identity disorder.
^ TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

He was just hungry for power.
So what you're saying, is he wasn't a bad guy, just hungry for power?
It's justa point of view, really.For some he was bad and for others good

Seems like a great guy to me.
Hitler is daddy 
well if you want a real answer you must first take a long hard look at how ww1 ended and start there, after ww1 germany had to endure one of the most terrifying and humiliating times in world history they had nothing the reichmark was worth nothing due to france demanding ridiculous sums of money for war reparations and when germany couldnt deliver the massive sums france helped themselves so to speak and took the coalmines in the ruhr, berlin was the cesspit of the world in the 1920s anyone and anything could be bought, sexclubs with children as young as 10-11 was all over berlin and perverts from all around the world stormed to berlin to capitalize on germanys hard times, and its in this era when germany is so morally bankrupt that hell itself would blush that the NSDAP takes form and gains strength from families who had to sell their daughters not even in their teens to old perverted men from all over the world just to get by each day and its these very ppl who wanted change more than anything else and that is when adolf hitler came into the picture (and as they say desperate times calls for desperate measures) so there where streetfights every day in berlin amongst other citys the farleft (the spartacists) and the far right (freikorps consisting of soldiers and veterans of ww1 still itching to fight for germany) fullscale civil war was a fact and part of daily life in germany inthe 20s and by night berlin was riddled with sin of the most diabolical kind and its in this cesspool of pervertedness and horrifying shit that hitler started to gain support by the thousands every day, so when the election of 1933 rolled around hitler won and promised to change things and he did he even chose to put up a NSDAP headquarter in a former pedophile sex club in berlin jsut to make a statement that things where going to change, and they did adolf hitler got rid of the massive unemployment problem and gave the people statefunded vacations (something that no other nation did during this time) and built several wonders such as the autobahn germany soon was no depraved state but a flourishing superpower and all this he achieved in 4 years so i have seen many old people from germany who to their death supported adolf hitler and said to those who asked how they possibly can think hitler was a great leader to this day that "you where not there you cant possibly understand the hell we lived in before hitler saved us" and since im a socially awkward emotionally detached individual i can see the germans from that times reasoning and i understand it even, its true we today cant possibly understand the horror that was germany after ww1 and to them hitler was a hero a saviour who saved both germany and the german people, im not promoting hitelr here dont get me wrong im jsut saying that there is two sides to every coin and furthermore this is the short version the story of hitelr and his rise and support is a long and complex one
TL; DR. ^
if it is then why ask such a complex question? i just tried to answer an enourmous question and that will be long.
Didn't ask it, not my post.
ok but why even remark that its to long when you know that question is extremely complex? and demands a long and thorough answer?
Used his power for evil. Yes, he was a bad guy.
It didn't REALLY require an input, it's a sarcastic questioin, because he didn't do anything wrong. I don't need a lengthy answer because I know my thoughts. As for witchcraft wife, you're most likely a jew

Still a rat though. An idiotic piece of shit tbh.
Hitler = Keemstar on a political scale.
so im gonna put up a thesis here that INSANITY is it formed over time or something you are born with?
so i have been thinking a long time that for example when shit happens alot it takes a toll on the psychee for example sweden where i live our politicians are so so so disconnected from reality that the entire left is infiltrated by islamists, militant islamists and when i was a little kid i witnessed on the news the killing of a politician named anna lind she was killed by an insane man who just went to one of her meetings in a mall and just stabbed her and he was declared insane, was this man insane by birth or driven to it by the madness that is todays society? and are the politicians realy that naive to think that when they make decisions over the ppls heads the ppl will just shrug their shoulders and pretend like nothing has happened? like its not a big deal to bypass the fundamentals of democracy, i for one think that insanity is osmething one can be driven towards out of necessity formed out of the current situation so in other words some forms of "insanity" is just a case of "desperate times calls for desperate measures" like just think about how many people right now as im writing this sits at home just boiling of hate towards the sitting government and just think how many of those millions of people actually are capable of doing something about it it doesnt take much, all you need is a kitchen knife and to have reached boiling point, do these "democrats" realy think they will get away with it just because they make the decisions, history has shown us that you cant rule a country without the people on your side, so again insanity is it born or formed over time
It depends. It can be about how one was raised. Osama Bin Laden was raised by a Muslim extremist, so he became a Muslim extremist. But I don't think Hitler was raised by fascists (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not very knowledgable on wwi/wwii history)
I just want a daddy to cut with and fuck whenever I'm bored rawr xD lolz I'm so random ofc you'll have to be okay with me cheating on you LOLZ

Do I even want to try to comprehend what is happening here?
What's the big deal here? There's people a lot more fucked up than her
I'm sorry but people who self-diagnose mental illnesses are kinda making things a little harder for those of us who were profesionally diagnosed. I'm in a few discussion groups for people with mental issues and we're targets for harassment from idiots who accuse us of making up our problems for attention.

It's also pretty annoying to see people on tumblr self-diagnosing themselves with long lists of mental illnesses. I'm pretty sure it's not possible for people to have both autism AND aspergers...
UHM EXCUSE YOU I HAVE DEPRESSION ANXIETY PTSD BIPOLAR DISORDER DIMENTIA AUTISM ADHD SCHIZOPHRENIA OCD I HAVE EVERYTHING I TOOK A TEST ONLINE I. AM. MESSED UP. XD i totally agree with you. if you self diagnose then go to a doctor and make sure so you can help ^-^ but girls nowadays think its cute to be extremely fucked up.
The worst is when kids on tumblr think you can get PTSD from online harassment
yep agree on that i was diagnosed with adhd, ocd, ptsd, bipolar disorder and aspergers when i was 14 and have since went to 9 different psychiatrists and behavioural therapists and i get a bit ticked of when i see people whine about getting ptsd from online bullying and say that online harassment is the same as physical and psychological bullying irl because their version of bullying is countered by doing as follows...TURN OF THE PC! when irl bullying is well its irl so you cant get away unless you change school/workplace so by propagating for "stop internet harassment" on the same level (often higher level and intensity) than irl harassment and bullying it makes me so fucking mad, i suffered through 9 years straight in 3 different schools of irl hardcore bullying so when i see these little shits whining about that they got ptsd from online harassment from stuff like mean fb comments i flip my shit basically its just so fucking dumb...
I agree. I see a lot of people saying they have severe anxiety all the time. Kinda pisses me off. They think just getting nervous a few times is anxiety. Then people don't believe the people who truly do have anxiety issues. When I took my CNA course my instructor almost took me to a hospital when I had an anxiety attack before big tests. She made me s e a doc and get meds  xD I totally agree with you on that one.
^I used to have severe anxiety about thunderstorms. On sundays my dad used to take me to the park and if there was even one cloud in the sky I refused to go and if I did go, I couldn't enjoy myself because I was just nervous about the weather. Once at a school picnic it was sunny but I still got so anxious that my teacher had to drive me back to the school so my mom could pick me up. Yeah...I'd never go back to that part of my life. Anxiety is definitely NOT cool/cute to have.
Find some other way to look interesting and cool, then.
^I don't make up my problems dude, I was professionally diagnosed with tourettes, ADHD, and anxiety
i see cassettes is as cancerous as ever
Actually, I'm referring to self diagnosis. It makes you look cool. If you oppose it so much, find an alternative.
Ever wondered what whale cum looks like?
^probably the same as humans'.
Derail warning
I'm bipolar, and I also have adhd and ocd. Three illnesses that kids are so quick to claim on tumblr. I never understood the aesthetic of being "fucked up" like, it kind of sucks????? It took me years to get officially diagnosed, it's far more complicated than googling your symptoms.
mmhm true shit and now people use it as a kind of badge of honor because it "sounds cool" i mean for us who suffer from these illnesses and have gone to the countless meetings done the many times realy weird tests and talked to several psychiatrists and gotten the paper to prove it finally its not something we chose to be just because, its something that just happened. nowadays people see it as an accesory and that is fucked up like they think they can just choose wich mental disorders to have.
^True. On another note, there's not really an age for having mental illness. I was 7 when I was diagnosed with tourettes and ADHD.
I feel man. I was ACTUALLY DOCTOR-diagnosed with PTSD, so it really pisses me off when people start wanting disorders and stuff.. It really urks me.

Okay so currently my sister is in the hospital because tonight she tried to take her life away by a bullet to her head. All because she was unloved and tricked. :'( Isabel was/is a very caring,hard working,sensitive person and she always helps people but never herself and she never disscusses her depression issues with anyone. Seeing my sister like that hurt so much to what no words can describe how I felt seeing her like that. But allow this to be a lesson to those responsible in this, suicide isnt a game and neither is my sister's life. Please dont try to lose your life just because of someone else.
Id honestly love to meet her one day
She should be back in two weeks as long as she starts to heal
Last night because this guy TheEndxXxX broke up with her and she told him if he ever did break up with her she'd kill herself because she loved him and she was accused of just being an attention seeker so she decided to prove she wasnt kidding
How do you know I'm not her friend? Just because a website says so, I still think you're full of it, Isabel. Suicide isn't funny. and No, You obviously don;t know how hospitals work. You should learn about how they work before you pretend to be in one. When you are admitted into a hospital you are under State care, You are under hospital care, Your parents sign you over to the hospital, Your parents sit in admission for hours, and sign paper after paper for a doctor to give you any medication, restrain you, And they are not responsible for you getting into fights, or you dying, or killing yourself or killing anybody else. But, BY LAW. You have rights in the hospital. But a phone call is a privilege . You get one phone call a day, maybe two. But the hospital can take that away from you. and you can only call family. or care takers. Try again, Isabel.
But isabel, I'm done now. No worries. Dont get nervous because im calling you out on your bullshit ,
No youre not my friend because if you were youd believe me but im better than to sit here and get upset over you being a bitch to me I dont care if you believe me only my true friends do and thats all that matters.
Um... A shot to the head is very difficult to survive. If she did shoot herself, she wouldn't be back in two weeks.
Suicide is horribly sad yet perfectly beautiful.
So much hate on here... We should all just chill and be friends.
More childish arguing...
My heart goes out to those affected by this tragedy.
i was in for the same thing last year i was in a mentle hospital for 6 days
I'm too dumb to even commit suicide :P

Anyone want to get fancy into religion? Feel free to discuss.I personally am a Christian.
Taoist
Christian
Catholic and partly Buddhist
Not a religon, obviously, but Atheism for me. It's an interesting mix on Emowire. :3
Christian here
Don't worry Kass, I still love you even though you are forced to be that. It means nothing to me :3 Oh, and as for myself I am Christian Atheist. I believe in the Christian was but I don't really believe in the Bible
Ways*
I wouldn't say I'm an Atheist, but I just don't believe in many things. Only in spirits, but I don't quite believe in religions.
Well I wasn't raised into Christianity, it's really hard to explain. I just have faith and believe. And usually for praying for the best for somebody, and being strong and having faith, the situation calms down. And I thank god verily. And yes, I have apologized for my sins. I have apologized a lot. I know I kinda sound weird but in all do honesty, by all means, I won't judge anyone for their religion :3 .
Athiest, i tolerate others religious beleifs, i dont mind what people beleive because its none of my buisness.
Catholic and Buddhist :3
I mean when it comes to Christianity, I dont really agree with some things that they teach or claim right.
Im more into Buddhism, basicaly because that there are so much more freedom and also their view to world.
Buddhist~
im suprised by the amount of christians here, its impressive of how many people are religiously diverse. it seems impressive and proves that emo is capable of so much
Religion on here is indeed diverse :D .
its a very hpapy thing to see, i hope poltics and opinions become more diverse and more nonconforming, it is a pleasure.
I don't really feel like I belong with any religious sect or group. It's pretty cool though, the human need to believe in something. I respect all religions as they're all quite interesting but I personally find it pointless. I take a particular liking to Nihilism but I am still nothing. just part of a collective species.
I'm Jewish (don't hate me :
I'm an ancient astronaut therosist :)
Athiest
A total atheist.
If you're a christian, don't feel insulted or anything but I've grown a dislike for the religion.
I still try to respect...But it's just hard at times.
^Same here. I know it's not all Christians, but I see Christianity as a hateful religion :/

To be honest  I am kind of in the middle of a lot of religions I like to learn all new ones I was baptized but I still want to learn new things.
Catholic, although I don't agree with some of their views (for example, I support homosexuality etc.)
Atheist here, but I respect what other people believe in
I was a JW until I was like 12, always hated it
I was raised in a christian home. It just wasn't for me. So i was in secret of Wicca for three years, but i turned agnostic.
Atheist here

I'm follower of mind.I Believe in whatever I see fit.Once my beliefs were close to christianity, once they were like Sci-Fi stories, Once close to atheism, once ...And still going on !
I'm a pagan, but its amazing sseeing the acceptance and diversity on this site!
So myself and a few friends are seriously thinking about converting from Christianity to Jediism and become followers of the Church of Jedi. We all have very little free time but have decided that if one of us goes through with it that we all will and will make time for our pillars of training and become official, certified Jedi. And no this isn't a joke, I'm being 100% dead serious
How much have you researched about it ?And what's the reason for that ?The most Important question :Which belief is more rational ? Which one does your mind accept ??
Hey stone!,
Just thinking, why not just live by your own rules, I bet you already do do that, but why do we need to formally claim a religeon?
I Know you didn't ask me but I just wanted to post my own answer ...

TheDude said:
Tch tch tch. You do notneed any rules to follow for yourself. Not talking about community rules which affect others.
Nope. Punishment ain't justice. Justice should be improving society.  My actions do not affect others. Give me a valid example.
TheDude said:

Influencing people? Don't wanna say it loud, but this point you make is stupid. That is the point. It is exploration of thoughts. To observe and think is human, to follow? Well even mules do that.

Nahh... You should paid because you need that money. Ideally your gaurd should pay because he failed his duty. I have worked with the army to build barricades against naxals. I don't want to punish, just helpnthose in need. Rapeists you say? My friend wasbraped. Want the convict to understand that what he did caused us pain and make him understand the right way
 No hate. If that needs brute force, or he just doesn't get the point? So be it
You're the first person I met who is so stuck... So stuck up.. So rigid. Don't know if it's good or bad. The world has no absolutes boy. If you believe in one
 You shall be disappointed.

Non-Religious o.o
I just believe that even if you aren't religious and don't believe in a God, that you should at least agree that the Bible's statements are great morales to live by. In other words the Bible really says most of the time that you should be grateful to be alive every day, you should treat others as they have treated you, and most of all you shouldn't live your life as an asshole because then after you die you will have to go on eternally knowing that no one remembers you fondly.
Only a few of the bible's statements are good morals to live by. The ones about women having to be subservient, and homosexuality being an abomination are utter bullshit.
I'm sort of a Gnostic Luciferian as well as a Unitarian Universalist. My great grandmother and my grandfather were/are Catholic, my mother is a Neo-Pagan, and my father is an atheist. To a degree I respected all of it but could never fully identify with an organized religion.
Wiccan, but I prefer the term neo pagan since I don't practice like a traditional wiccan.

In reference to What Anodyne said Heres a PDF of the Satanic Bible Underground Edition by Lavey himself,

Grew up a Christian my entire life... now that I realize I'm not, I'm in agony over the pointlessness of life.
If you have a religion, hang on to it.
All lives are pointless at first. You must give your own life purpose.
You just had the best dream ever (you dream every night) you lived the best week of your life! It was so great! Then you wake up and brush your teeth. You dont remember a thing. Nothing remains. Because no matter how a life goes it is only a dream. 

It really isn't healthy for the mind to have that kind of pessimistic mentality
Your probally right! But it doesent matter. You die, nothing else. So my state of mind is of no consequence, is it?
I'm not religious, but who says there's nothing after death? Nobody alive knows, you only find out when you die.
Why would there be? Do you have proof of anything, anything at all spiritual?
Your speculation, like the rest of everyone, is only formed by your wistfullness.
(Yo this is a debate, pls lets not get angry at eachother btw just in case u r :])
You don't have proof of there being nothing after death, I don't have proof of there being something. It's not debatable.
Hey.
Or mabey...
WE WON'T
Because there is nothing to know.
Are you denying that as a possibility?
(Sorry for shouting im chill just some low-key empathise)
With what we can know, the Brain releases massive amounts of DMT upon death, So you are in a dream that makes 10 minutes seem like 10, 20, or even 50 years. 

there are stories of people who even life entire lifes only to realize that they are in a dream an then wake up afterward.

So we clearly do experience SOMETHING that happens when We die. because when we die we will probably have a DMT trip, It depends really, There are some deaths that may completly smash the brain so you cant see such things, 

So you may see a DMT trip upon death, Or you may see nothing at all. And if you do experience a DMT trip, imagine how long it could be within the first several days of dying.
Thats pretty cool, I like that a lot, it still ends though.
Tell me why and how if you would.
I'll be spooning the person to death
I hope you mean with litteral spoons!
nope I meant by spooning with the person :3
No I wouldn't
you guys got issues xD
I've never understood hatred, it's a stupid emotion that's make you hurt yourself because you are mad at someone else ahaha xD. You should try to let go theses dark feelings of yours and think about more joyful things.
theses are similar feelings that end to the same result. I prefer focusing on my work, my hobbies and my interests. Than thinking about people I dislike, it make a whole lot of difference in life :3
I do honestly focus on hobbies most of the time. Only once in a blue moon like today do I think about these things.
well I never think about people I hate, I don't give them any place in my life. and when I would be about to think about them... well I wank a good time and that's all ahaha xD
I guess we all have different pass times haha
yeahh I guess we may have... be warned I could try to tempt you to the dark side x3
Honey, I AM the dark side xD
ohhhh.... have you ever danced with the devil under the pale moon light?
Well... let me think about the ways how I would do this. Suicide bombing, MK-19 grenade launcher maybe nuclear holocaust... so many ways to do something so fun :D
Yes. It's my line of work
Done it before, why not again.....
And if so, knives are my favorite, cutting the beautiful butterflies into the skin.....oh how wonderful they shall look when i am done carving them into a masterpiece!!
Torture is fun as well, skinning and wearing it as a coat is another option.
I'd only kill bad people like murders, rapists pedophiles, abusers, corrupt people ect. I'd kill people how the Assassins on Assassins Creed with a Hidden blade like what the Assassins wear to hide their hidden blades on that game.
It would be Justice for me because some people get away with horrible things and deserve to die. I'd do it by assassination.
Depends on the person, really.
Yes. I would kill someone. Because she screwed with my life so much. She even tried to kill me. How I would kill her you ask, First I'd use a sedative and drag her into the woods in the middle of no where. I'd wear gloves and have my body covered in plastic, including my shoes. When she woke up I'd have a sinister grin and tell her WHY I'm doing this to her. I'd take out a needle and sew her eyelids under her eyebros and to her cheek so she has to watch everything I do. Next, I'd shove knives in the edges of her skin, pinning her to something. Then I'd slowly made a few cuts along her neck, then take away the thing she loves the most, her hair. I'd burn it in front of her. Then, I's start to rip out her organs, keeping her alive before I dump kerosine oil on them and light them on fire as I watch her burn. When her body is fully burned, I'll toss my clothes into the flames and grind up her bones so that there is no evidence. (PLEASE DO NOT BE WORRIED THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS. THE GIRL MOVED TO AUSTRALIA)
How utterly beautiful, i am happy that there are others with such wonderful imaginations such as my own.
Me?
Of course. I find your description to be quite revitalizing. Thank you.

If you want I can tell you who it is
I am open to know anything you wish me to.
I like that idea. Some of us have already grasped insanity and are merely waiting to finally snap.
Well I feel killing or wanting to kill is pointless. Live is too short for hatred... I have way more interesting way to spend my time
Many such as myself do not wish to bear hatred, some of us are born with it.....molded into beasts that lust for blood. It is choice for many of you, but for some there is no way to rid of this bloodlust.
I think hatred is stupid... it's basically an emotion that consist about hurting yourself because you hate someone else.
I have an advice for you, find an activity that help you to evacuate both your stress and frustations, Use it to release your anger. I swear it's gonna make you a new person

I do not think it's simple, I just think if you put the effort in it you can truly makes your life better. You are the sculptor of your own life
Perhaps, but one's life is also dependant on interactions with other people, and that in turn effects the outcome of one's mental landscape. Are you insinuating that i have not tried? That i dont care for anything? That i am another useless being hellbent on destruction for no reason? Perhaps you are correct in some cases, but i assure you i have tried, i spent much of my younger years in a mental hospital: trying. Is it not acceptable to be what i am? I tried many things, and yet nothing works, do you know why? It is because the thing you wish for me to change, is not meant to be changed. Who and what i am, they are not meant to be tampered with, as it has been altered through my past experience. So you cannot say that i havent tried. Who are you to know what i have and haven't done? Even still, i hate discussing myself, it makes me feel as though you look at this problem as a small matter. There are many who suffer just as i do, and my thought is: if i can survive it, so can they. We do not need to change who we are to suit your social agenda, we only need to fight these monsters within, and find acceptance in our own sorrows.
I agree with you Dylan, but I can never forget watching her scream in her sleep, struggling all around screaming to stop that he's hurting her, all the nightmares she suffered with over them because of everything they did to her. All the scars on her body she tried to hide from me because she couldn't forget what they did. Even as I type this I can't stop shaking. I have nightmares about it all, about watching her and not be able to help her or do anything... Her screams echo through my mind over and over because of them... Because of him, because of those few people she actually trusted who used it against her. I can never forget or give those guys...
I know what you mean, and it must be something horrible to bear with it, and I'm not talking about forgiving something horrible that has been done. I'm more talking about focusing your energy somewhere else on building something new and better
Dude... this discussion is fuckin' creepy man. O.o In the army, we did have to work on a mine-field in a major Naxal area. They'd keep attacking the villagers. So we had to lay down a mine-field. "practice for you" said the commander. Hated it man. Just the thought of killing someone is too scary for me. And the forest thing... and assassin thing man... you people need to calm the fuck down. Or watch a movie or smoke or fap. Anything would do, but kill the negativity man... it burns yee.
yeahhh xD finally someone with sense.... everyone feel anger, we just need to find a constructive way to expulse it from us, and if there's nothing constructive to work on.... wanking works wonder indeed
Totally dude. Like when totally pissed go do push ups or something. Or run!!!! Running's awsome too dude!
@BeautyWithinTheLifeless...
Do you believe in hypnosis? I do, very much indeed! It does help clear inner negativity. Try the s.t.e.m.s. process to reveal all your emotional stress. I'll forward it to you. it is a set of questions you need to ask yourself repeatedly untill you have an emotionla out break. Once that is done, go for this hypnosis for clearing sub-concious negativity vid on yourtube. It has a candle in its picture. Be sure to try it out.
Still you have yet to understand, but i shall not pester you any longer with my own problems. Yes, i have tried hypnosis therapy along with many other things, but as i said before, none of it works. It isnt emotional stress, it is the hatred i feel for myself as a form of barrier against.....things within me i dont think you would understand. They say it is wrong to be you, and yet they tell you that you are a monster when you take their advice. The only thing left for myself and others is resorting to masks, to false identities within the human mind. Society will never accept us for we are a sign of reality.
How old are you my friend?
Yes you should accept you as you are. You are perfect!!! No issues. The problem is when you do not. Love what you are.
To love being a bloodthirsty beast is unwise. If i accept him....then the death of myself and many others would be imminent.
I am whatever age you might believe me to be. Some say i am in my 30's, others say i am in my teens.
-_-
Gaze upon me with your eyes of disaproval, i dont mind, it is not as if i havent already faced judgment already. Act as though i am lying, i care not, the truth can purify oneself and condemn oneself to a hell in which i inhabit. So go ahead and judge me like all the rest. Your gaze will never reach me, and your words will die in my heart.
I do not like what i am, but i cannot change it either. Acceptance seems to be the obvious course of action. And yet with that, a door to a far darker place would open. Perhaps it is right for me to cross that line. Perhaps not. I do not try to stay stuck inside of my own problems, instead i try to stride forward. At times one must look back to see what has become of them, to question the path taken and further evaluate the situation. Perhaps i have gone too far. Perhaps not. Either way, i shall fade with the tide, and rise once again with the moon at my back.
You're so poetic... I'm just saying, you don't have to accept what you don't like. You can keep pushing yourself through anything that gets in your way and become what you truly want to be... The same goes for most things. I want to change the world because I can't stand it as it is today and I will change it for the better. There is a lot of work to be done on my part if I am to do this though... and there I go I was nearly onto another topic so I'm done now.
Bro you need to chill. xD
If you killed someone and you aren't the law or in the army why aren't you in prison?
I served my time in a mental hospital, because i was so young they felt it would be brutal to place me in juvenile detention. After i was released, i was assigned to a therapist, and a long story after that.
Well this was worth the read :)
Maybe yes, maybe no ;-;
yes i would kill someone if they commit certain acts wich is primarily rape and pedophilia
if a person commits one or both of these acts i see it as if they have forfeited their humanity i see them as mere animals and should be treated as a common snail pestering your garden.
True that^
well that puts things into a nice intelligently put perspective anodyne u realy have the talent of writing :) and while i do agree with ur post i must add that maaaany people such as myself has certain diagnoses that stops the brain from using moral in a subject such as if someone has done a thing such as rape or another horrible act of violence upon someone i care deeply about my brain turns of n i could without problems kill someone by curbstomping them, (im not psycho i have aspergers wich basically means i have extremely hard to feel empathy but it also means that i give unbiased response to things) for example i am a promoter of the deathpenalty when it comes to terror crimes and pedophilia some people (well most) thinks that i am a monster for saying that a man who rapes a child should get a bullet to the head, u see in my logical little world he the rapist should not get payed prisonstay on taxpayers money it costs waaay to much and they cant be rehabilitated therefore they will do it again and again so my logical non emotional brain says that the only solution is death a bullet costs about 2 dollars, its like when i signed up for the military here in sweden they shut me out because of "psychological instability" due to me having aspergers, adhd, bipolar disorder and extreme lack of empathy they basically made me sound like a total psycho in their "excuse" to not letting me serve in afghanistan for a 2 year stretch. i just wanted to protect people from isis n such but because of peoples view on my diagnoses im considered psychologically unfit for service, so in conclussion it depends on the guy or woman holding the gun, bat, pipe, or any other form of weapon and that guy who just bashed another guys brain in might have had a extremely good reason for it but since our society of today is totally based on moral standards the real psychos gets free empathy passes wich is total fucking idiocy
In all technicalities, that puts you in the minority position in this discussion. If you already have something inhibiting your ability to feel empathy, you can't answer question that's rooted in morality without a large bias. Our empathy and knowledge of society is what allows us to make important split second moral decisions. I don't disagree that there are plenty of extreme situations that could call for the death penalty. I think that population control is quite an important thing in all honesty. Our world is full of violent people, and although there is hope at rehabilitation (something that's shown really well in European prisons) I don't feel that everyone deserves that second chance. Hell, even if we don't have the death penalty in effect, the least we could do is chemical castration so that we can prevent people like that from moving the human race forward (or backward?). I don't agree with eugenics when it comes to "racial purity" and shit like that, but if we're talking about hard criminals and the legitimate mentally insane? I think it's absolutely something to consider.
I completely understand why the military wouldn't enlist you due to the mental diagnosis. Even if you as an individual are in control, there's too many chances of someone with the same slurry of disorders to make the wrong decision in a crisis situation due to the inhibition of empathy. Laws are problematic, because ideally we'd be able to take everything as a case by case basis, analysing every angle of the situation presented, but we can't. It would encroach on human rights, personal freedoms, and privacy. Due to this, they have to make umbrella laws that dictate what can and cannot be allowed. It could be very likely that someone with severe bipolar disorder and aspergers might act out violently when the situation doesn't call for it, and that's exactly why you weren't allowed in. With our current knowledge of the disorders and disabilities, it poses a lot of risks to give a gun to someone who is potentially unstable.I pass no judgment on people with mental disabilities so long as they can control themselves, so don't take my message as a direct attack on your character or something of the like, this is just a rant from my perspective.
i once again am baffeled by your ability to express yourself in words :) and no im not taking any offence i know that im not the best to ask about morally complicated choices since i put the good next to the bad for example if someone commits a horrible crime that does not kill such as rape or severe violence this in turn could lead to the victim in question to commit suicide or at the very least be mentally and psychologically damaged for all time wich in some ways is worse than death so if this guy who commits this crime gets a 3-6 years sentence for brutal violence or any other violence related crime and that is then considered "served his time" and "payed his debt to society" i strongly believe that the person responsible for inflicting such psychological and physical harm that will plague and haunt this victim for his or hers entire life should be put to death and not a prison sentence, i live in sweden our prisonsentences are jokes it has become such a moral controlled situation here that now there is no longer a question of "why did the rapist do it" now its the disgusting question towards the victim "did you make sufficient resistance and hold your legs closed" and that is the result of a society gone totally batshit crazy overboard with a empathy controlled legal system, and the empathy has come to such a disgusting degree that the most violent and disgusting of fellons gets separate wards where the rest of the inmates cant get to them just because of empathy that somehow we are supposed to feel for a guy who has raped a 11 year old girl to death (that actually happened here) and the papers wrote about it as if he was the victim, that is how much the empathy controls this country, sweden is a enourmous crisscross of different empathy guided rules and exceptions such as psychological,drug related,ethnicity,if the rape victim made totaly clear to not wanting to get raped etc etc the list goes on its a giant joke our legalsystem is upside down and no country should want to mimic our model of empathy driven madhouse system
I would, for any personal gain whatsoever. But i dont want to get into trouble and im super lazy to not do the planning involved in it.
Mabey i would feel bad afterwords...Mabey I'm unknowingly saying BS and i wouldent do it...
But ive done stupeder things for no reasons before, and never do I learn my lesson that it was not worth it.

Those who pose a signifigant threat to my safety will be dealt with.
And i absolutly agree with what Anodyne said. We are improving as a society, when thing get serious we are considerate and kind. when it comes to enetertainment, we know better, but we find amusement out of knowing its fictional, Anyways yeah, when shit like this really happens we react better than back then.
Do you Feel mankind will ever make it to space? what will it be like? what will the politics be like in space. Do you feel nations of today could one day be a spacefaring empire?
Stephen hawkings: in 50 years we should have the tech to build a moon base, in 100 years we should be able to build a colony on Mars.
Luckily we seem to be getting closer to it C:
Someone once said that humanity will be safe from cataclysm once we expand upon the stars...
That, and It's the most humane solution to overpopulation.
Agreed.
That moment when you feel all alone.. And question what Ur worth is just to find out you're worthless! I don't actually have the balls to pull the trigger but I wish everyday that my heart would just stop beatin.
Personally, I dont think anyone, no matter who, can be worthless. How could you find your worth?
(I only question the worth of life itself:[) 

Hey guys! My name is Karla...I'm very lonely and would love to find someone to be the cookie to my cookie monster. I am a hopeless romantic and I want to find my forever (stupid I know). I have found my true love but I lost him...so yeah. I'm just a broken soul....
I wonder how many members live in carolina though...
[Thought you might appreciate a reply regardless of the content...Its probally awkward for people to reply; but it is probably more for you if no one does.]
I know it's stupid but I thought what the hell I'll give it a shot I mean you never know I'm not looking exactly right now for a girlfriend but if you are interested then maybe we could start talking and see where it leads I'm okay with an online long distance relationship I've had a couple before. Also It'd be nice if you were into anime to Lolx
You and like 80% of the people on here. You'll probably be with one of these kids by the end of the week xD
Heyyy I am looking as well and tbh I am sooo into Anime. It is litterally all I watch. I am open to talk to anyone at any point..soo hmu I guess lol
Just why

Emowire's new motto.
Jeez isn't this new xD
Hi just a single emo.
Lonely emo I'm really looking for a gf in USA pa I need connections with girls who are near me but are that emo.
hi
i just wanted to say a few things regarding subcultures, if you since an early age have been through shit (psychological,physical etc etc) and your young brittle mind gets put through shit that most adults never have to witness is it then strange that a person become somewhat different... you then can become introverted and have a negative outlook on life before it has even begun, and this is where shit gets interesting and where people starts the labeling...if a person have endured abuse and then turns into somewhat negative, dark, emotional etc etc being that is not strange at all its a normal response to an abnormal situation and in order for the mind of this individual to cope it endured and then released the locks and BAM now we have an emotionally damaged individual who will just because of abnormal and absurd shit gets labeled as an "emo" with all that it means. people have a need to relate to other people just lika any other pack animal, and poof now we have the "townies" (for example) a gang of people who have been through shit and got emotionally damaged during their childhood and that is a pretty strong bond to have i mean when i was like 12 my only friend then said that he lived with his mom and not both and i naturally just like the sky is blue thought and said "oh so he hit her huh" and he jsut stared at me and said "no are you stupid!?" so when i found other who had a shit childhood and i finally didnt have to feel weird i was so relieved adn felt like a part of something (i used to be a townie and i know all to well how it felt when i finally had people to relate to it was awesome more awesome than any antidepressant ever could make me feel infact i stopped with antidepressants while i hanged with them), i dont care what people who keeps puking the word "emofuck" think. they who do not understand the darker subcultures will never understand since they do not know or can comprehend how it was created under dark circumstances (im not trying to be all edgy or anything im just stating facts) and many bands who are considered emo also has dark pasts (are you who use emo as a slur seeing a pattern yet?) so in conclussion by using the word emo as a slur and laugh at it like its something funny you just prove that you have had a to happy life to know how it feels to be totally fucked in the head from an early age...
This is agreeable. I shall assist in the clarification, emo, by definition has no bearing on ones lifestyle. A simple subculture of people who choose to like and take part in emotional works. A common misconception is that all or most emos are cutters, highly incorrect. I myself am not emo, however i am a cutter, and i find it to be quite annoying when the two are grouped together when they themselves, have separate definitions and underlying circumstances. So thank you for beginning something i should have taken part in a time long ago.
So, the UK's left the EU. Was this a good idea or not?
They don't exist at all, the closest thing we have to a vampire are lawyers.
Of course witches exist. Werewolves, no. Vampires, maybe. I somewhat believe they do and call me stupid but my reason is that tales of vampires probably originated from some unfortunate occurences. Perhaps they didn't stay as hidden as they do now 800 years ago, and after some mishaps decided to stay in hiding.
witches exist (met one myself funny story actually) vampires exist just not in the way people might think (i have seen proof of vampirism but in the form of energy vampires) werewolves no they do not exist the thing that people in the middleages has described was most likely a direwolf they do not exist anymore though (although they could exist in places such as apalachia mountains or any other deep heavy forested area) and furthermore on the topic of witches the one i met she was a friends mother and when we walked through the door in to her kitchen she sat by the kitchen table drinking coffee when she saw me and my friend walking in and she said hi and asked me if i knew i had people with me, and i asked what she meant and she said (and remember this is the first time we met) she said yes you have 4 german soldiers following you around and there was no way she could have known that i collect old nazi germany artefacts, and she exlpained that my aura was grey and then she explained that she was a wiccan and i had read about them before so i was a little bit educated in it so we discussed it for a bit so yeah that was a bit awesome :)
And how do you know she wasn't just making all this up?
Maybe your friend told her about the collection or yours? Maybe it was just a guess?
i do not tell just anyone about my collection. i only tell a select few and do not allow anyone in the vicinity of the collection due to the "offensive" nature of it 

and so you mean she nailed the very specific comment german soldiers? its not something you just guessits very weird to just make up from nowhere, and i know that germans are haunting me since i even have video proof now (i have one more vid but my girlfriend has it and in that my cat is chasing the orbs)
I had a wiccan phase and I thought a spell to make me a vampire really worked. I thought I was a vampire for at least a month.
Let's see that one, then.
I'm referring to the video Gas mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPFZOZ1wfQ
I don't see anything.
Wait until nearly the end, little red dots of light fly across the screen
Nope, still don't see anything.
i am actually trying to get stir up something as we speak and im getting relevant intelligent answers when i ask questions and i even invited the ehtity to sit here besides me and watch youtube so i got the answer befriend through the emf based vocalized ghost voice thing i have and i also asked can you knock and said please and knocked on the wall just to show and then it knocked twice right next to me and im in a basement no neighbouring rooms. and since i stirred things up (wich allways happen i might add)i have gotten pounding headache and a bit well it almost feels like you wake up from a party and are dried out and dizzy and the room im currently in has dropped to so low that i must wear a jacket and hoodie (and here we had 35 degrees today) and im sitting here in a jacket and hoodie

That could very well be some dust.
they move in very different speeds and in very different ways 0:25 one white moves across the screen and 0:35 one moving a bit slower on a straight intelligent line from left to right close to the cam 0:43 you can see one in the middle of the screen just very fast dodging past the camera and 0:52 a fast small one tha materialises infront of the cabinet and moves up towards the right and just disapears close to the cabinet door to the right, you can even see how the one in 0:43 moving in a very intelligent way it moves extremely fast and turns 

the thing im refering to is a program you can use to pick up electromagnetic pulses wich means it can catch voices not audible by the naked ear and that program picks up on these inaudible voices and on the screen it comes up what the supposed voice said and if it is relevant and not gibberish it is considered unexplained and thus paranormal you can for example ask questions and point to pics as me and my gf did we pulled up pics of jesus and it said stigmata wich was very fucking specific and then we showed a pic of hitler and it said leader so yeah cassettes thats basically what it is
Hold up, a program that detects shit related to electromagnetic interference? Is there any extra hardware needed?
nope you just need a relatively new phone in the upper priceranges i use a windows phone (dont know if its just the expensive ones with more stuff in it but my w8 phone works as one) my w8 phone can when i install a emf program efectively use its ability to pick up electromagnetic evergies from taking something as basic as phonecalls and turns it into a emf device that can detect inaudible emf signatures and shows it in words on my screen so basically it detects voices in the same way phonecalls work and in order to test it you can do as i did and ask question and if you get relevant answers and responses it is likely it is a paranormal fluctuation
Yup, yup, it's probably bullshit.
ok your opinion

The nazis have still existed regardless if the book is there or not. And what's so bad about Hitler when Stalin is 50x worse?
Mein Kampf shouldn't be censored -- it should be completely uncensored so we can understand history from the perspective of Hitler himself to its fullest.. History has already been written so there's no point in trying to censor non-fictional words that have had a played a giant role in terms of historical events.
I agree.
b0ss said:
from the perspective of Hitler himself
Got a point there, I think he means directly from Hitler however, The very source of the Public Perspective of Nazi Germany.
Well... No. Everyone was thinking this stuff, Hitler just put it into words. This perspective was around probably quite a while before Hitler even wrote Mein Kampf.
With Automation on the rise and Machines replacing jobs and serving as a means to more production and efficiency, Do you think we would shift from being souly a capitalist Society to becoming more of an Automated Society where a majority of Human work is Working on the machines, Scholars, And higher up jobs involving leadership, The jobs we want, and Ect.

Not sarcastic, i enjoyed ur comment. Also, may I point out, this kid says he can beat anyone in anygame because we're less than him...like...ok?

AS IF THERE IS ONE.
I'm a huge fan of FNAF, and have a ton of FNAF t-shirts xD. It really does have an awesome story line and the book he put out is really good too, I certainly hope he writes more.
There's a book? O.O
Yep! I think it's really good. It's called "Five Nights at Freddy's The Silver Eyes". I bought it online off of Barnes and Noble's website.
Maybe I should check it out the next time I order online... :)
Around summer time xD
It's definitely worth it! The story line isn't 100% like the games, so treat it as something almost completely new. It will seem kinda weird at first but it all comes together and makes sense if you just keep reading. I'm hoping he will turn it into a series!
Thank you for the recommendation! :D
DO YOU NOT SEE JUST HOW MUCH OF A CASH COW FNAF IS?

he used his own youtube channel to attack his ex GF, that's kind of low. He's making fat shaming and really hateful comments about certain genre of people. I think he's an immature brat who is using his youtube channel to bully other. He's not offending people or talking about sensible topics, he's just being a narcissistic brat who tend to hurt people.
*quick note: I'm not taking any sides. I just want to know what people think.
People are getting butthurt because he's telling the truth lol
Some of his stuff, i feel, are aimed at what his fans would think to make sure they're on his side. Particularly his videos on Feminism. It's like he makes those videos purely to attract your average Tumblr feminist and he's awful with statistics and looking at context.
Trying to be edgy and funny
Tumblr-slay culture ;o
Yes Lory, he try to rally the average Tumblr teenagers girls on his side.
When you look at things he's one of the most hated youtubers and it's not because he's telling the truth, he's just an hypocrite with a really negative attitude who enjoy bashing on everyone who doesn't agree with him. Most of his video are just there to start drama and are filled with extreme douchery topic. He made multiple video just to humiliate his ex GF over internet. He made an entire fat shaming video, I think everyone agree that being obese isn't healthy. But, humiliating the fat kid in the schoolyard is just worse. When you keep throwing negativity around you like he does, it end coming back to you. Which is why he's highly hated.
I agree with Kikiroh.
he makes me laugh.
i never take most of his shit seriosuly ;3
I'm personally not a fan. I don't think he's a very good person and I'd even go as far as saying he's immature for the way he has handled some of his personal life affairs and the way he made them public when they didn't need to be that way?
I think he's an incredibly ignorant person.
The ex-girlfriend shaming videos were the last straw for me /.\
I can't believe that it's the ex girlfriend videos that count as the last straw for people._. My last straw was when he killed his turtle by being a fucking idiot. All subsequent events only reinforce my opinion of him.
He whaattt?? :O How?
Turtles 
He decided to put his turtle underneath a plastic tote in the middle of summer and suffocated it to death. He tried to take the heat off himself and say that the turtle died from stress thanks to his neighbours, but anyone with more than two brain cells should probably know that air holes for ventilation need to be put in any container to allow an animal to breathe. He cooked his turtle to death, slowly, and agonisingly.
The problem is that he has no tact. Even his opinions that I agree with, he finds the most horrendous and insulting way to execute it. Yay for freedom of speech and whatnot, but too many people see "free speech" and take it as "free to be a prick"
i find onison blunt yet, right on alot of subjects. i dont agree with everything. but he is funny.
Oh wow. He killed the turtle in a more brutal way than I would have guessed .
Onision being one of my all time favorite YouTubers, I have to say that sometimes he can be stupid as hell and counter himself in varying videos.
Some of his videos are funny. Other times he seems like hes just running his mouth and causeing unsessecary Drama between him and his multiple ex girlfriends. He has his faults. but overall Hes not a terrible person.
He's a pretty terrible person. I can agree that he can be funny, but he's very low on my list of people I respect. A good person wouldn't publicly humiliate people for fun, which he frequently does either about his real life relationships, or fellow youtubers.
Come to think of it. Perhaps your right.
In my mind, you can't say things to people that are directly meant to offend them or make them sad or feel miserable or even worse, then say it was just a joke it's a prank bro. No you can't if you do that you're a terrible person. He's making a living out of making some people feel miserable, that's not how a decent human being act at all.

None of which who he has targetted has given a single fuck. He's not making anyone sad, he's not making anyone miserable. He's literally just talking to himself when he makes videos the way he does. He's more open about expressing the way he feels. The things about his ex's? They've done shit worthy to be targetted. Oh, let me guess:"No one deserves to be targetted, no matter what they do."Bullshit. Anyone and everyone can be targetted with something they've done in the past. The way they handle it is what matters. Look at LeafyIsHere. He can be a funny guy, but he targets people that are cringey. In no way does he want them to jump off a bridge or kill themselves or some shit. There was already an incident where he didn't do enough research and ended up targetting an autistic man. Some people grow to popularity in this way and it doesn't harm a single bean.D'aw, wook. Poodiepaw is getting bashed on by Dillon The Hacker.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_UCHv47uALik if u cri evrtim.ANYONE and I mean ANYONE who becomes popular in media are going to get bashed on. As I've said before, it depends on the way they handle it. Some bitch ass kid came on my Twitch a couple weeks ago and told me I shouldn't stream because I'm a kid (15 atm). I could've slit my wrists and hung off a noose, but I didn't. You want to know why? Because I'm not a damn baby and know that I'm better than that shit. Do you think I'm making fun of people who self harm and kill themselves? Well, I'm not. I literally just demonstrated a real life situation that could've happened.Either way, Onision is doing nothing wrong. He is stupid sometimes but overall is one of my favorite YouTubers. I don't agree with everything he says, but either way, he's a god damn fine person.EDIT: For those of you guys getting all triggered from videos like his cutting videos and whatever, don't like it? Don't fucking watch it. Simple as that. If you do watch it, that's your own fault. 

I think he is a terrible excuse for a human being, he has no moral value or standard. he's a narcissic person who only care about himself, and enjoy hurting other.

I dunno, killing an animal out of neglect and stupidity and not taking responsibility for his actions while claiming to be an animal rights activist certainly doesn't show off a heart of gold.

Very much so.
I just enjoy him and he actually help me stop cutting so yeah that's my thoughts
Oh yes.
Let's discuss.
Favorite?
Least Favorite?
Funny things you've encountered?
FF10 was one of my favorites i belive it was my first
FFVI forever.
It's my favorite movie in the whole world. But it's hard to find people who like it as much as I do. So, anyone?
not to sound weird but I saw ur post and I was interested in by the words of what you were asking, I searched the movie and I just finished it. Might I say that it is amazing, insightful, a bit sad and many more but I really like the plot of it all. :3
I really like the book, did a project on it and all
it was so funny when alex hit his friend in the ballas because of the lady singing XD
I watch a lot of manga. ^-^ 

Tokyo Ghoul.
FMA.
Death Note.
The Future Diary. 
Inuyasha.
Another.
etc. ^-^                      

Hunter x Hunter
Lucky Star and Another 
I like to read and watch so both.
My favorites are Psycho Pass, Attack on Titan and Black Butler.
Naruto, deathnote, code geass ahhhhhhh its so hard to choose ;-;
Gonna try to finish Bodacious Space Pirates soon
Naruto.  Will forever be remembered T.T
Either Steins Gate or Log Horizon :D

Anime: Kuroko no basket - Attack on Titan - Tokyo Ghoul
im really into tokyo ghoul and inuyasha right now
I'm really into Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, Deadman Wonderland, and Attack On Titan currently.
manga, anime, pokemon!
Am more of a anime person but do read certain mangas.Some animes that I really enjoyed and have yet to be listed would be:

Ergo Proxy
Death Parade
Cybersix (yes it can be considered an anime)
Hellgirl
Witchblade
Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt

Sometimes if I really enjoyed the anime, I'll read the manga afterwards.
does anyone here watch future diary or rosario vampire?
I watched some of Rosario vampire I have a habit of watching an episode from each anime...and I've never read manga before...probably because I'm picky or because I prefer to read like books but I spend a huge majority of my time watching anime lol ...I'm lame i know
My favorites are:
Inuyasha and my little monster 

I started Death Note a week ago and have been watching a few episodes every day. I thought it was fucking amazing until I got to episode 18 today...it's all over the place and confusing especially this new plot twist about the corporation killing off businessmen. I love L too much to give it up, I'm gonna finish the series but I hope it gets back on track within the next few episodes (no spoilers please). 

Anime and manga are all the same and fucking boring.

Says you.
Watch 2 animes and then come back and say they have the same plot. The only way anyone would be saying they're "all the same" is if they've never. Watched. Any.
And yeah, this is a 3edgy5me situation. A middle school kid who's too sophisticated for an aspect of pop culture and feels the need to share their salty opinion on it. 

I've tried to watch AoT and Death Note. They were both boring and samey. And don't even get me started on the actual animation.
Ooooh you must be SUCH an expert on animation.
I have you blocked, you aren't supposed to be able to see anything I post. Did you find a way to override that or something?
I don't need to have a degree in music production to say that Justin Beiber's "Baby" is shit. The same logic should supply here.
That song is shit. That, however, is opinion. People who like his music just have different music tastes. Your opinions aren't fact. Life is a hell of a lot more enjoyable if you let people like the things they like.
I like pointing out the flaws in things. So stop being a hypocrite~
Show me where I was a hypocrite.
"Life is a hell of a lot more enjoyable if you let people like the things they like."
In this sentence, you're practically telling me not to do this stuff. But you are also telling me not to do something I enjoy.
Pointing out the flaws in things is such a pessimistic thing to "enjoy".
By the way, no, I'm still blocked from seeing your profile. Not posts.
It is. But I enjoy it.
I haven't even finished Deathnote -.- my parents gave my sister my phone so I couldn't watch it and plus I've been busy lately
Good, you didn't become a weeaboo.
Lol

Sure, keep deluding yourself.
You make no sense whatsoever. You're 13, quit acting like you know everything. You're not the authority on the definition of a weeaboo. 

You seem to have this thing with me being 13. Age has nothing to do with the subject at hand. And you aren't the authority either.

I've seen some episodes of One Piece on Adult Swim but I never got the chance to watch it
It is epic! You can watch it on Hulu.
Oh my lord you're a life saver I didn't even think of that I just use Netflix for the majority of my shows and then kissanime
It's also on Crunchyroll
Awe I don't use crunchyroll hehe my ipod isn't exactly the newest
crunchyroll isn't just an app it's a website too
O! Thanks
But on Crunchyroll it has you pay for certain episodes. Use Hulu, CR isn't worth the hassle (I know Hulu is paid but still)
Hulu not hulu plus right? Because I heard that Hulu plus is where you pay and hulu is free
Yeah.
SomeOne watched AnoHana the flower we saw that day
I really love that short series.
I've seen many anime and read many manga but the bests are:
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Berserk
Mirai Nikki
Black Butler
but jojo is the best :D
I grew up on Dragon Ball Z,
Sailor Moon, Card Captors, Gundam, and Cyborg009,
I didn't see those listed so I'm guessing I'm the only one that maybe liked them?...
Also liked and currently watching Fairy Tail...

I've watched all the anime listed by everyone above,
and by this I'm sure you can guess that I'm more of an anime than manga...
I'm just not a reader...
I love Fairy Tail my number one favorite.
-_- These are my kind of people don't disrespect my kind of people or face The Wrath Of My Tormented soul......
Has nobody said Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, One Punch Man, Mushi-shi, Chrono's Crusade, or Parasyte yet??? What the hell? These are some of the best television shows I've ever seen.
One Punch Man is 1000000% worth the hype. It's fucking hilarious!
Also, watch the movies Akira and Grace of the Fireflies.

I prefer Osu then Audiosurf 2. What do u think? Haha but I have Steam too! wanna play something? c(x I'm bored af.
I've only played Osu once or twice, but I quite like it cx I love multiplayer games too, but sadly my graphics card and internet are both too shit to play most of the games that I'm usually into. If you wanna add me, we can compare game libraries and figure out what we CAN play once I get a more solid connection and rebuild my computer :D
You said you're in Germany on your profile, yes? I'd have to switch to the European servers to play with you since I'm on the North American ones, but I'm a level 30 c: I play a bit of everything, but I main ADC and Mid
Darn.. I don't have Audiosurf.. I have Vindictus, Zombies Monsters Robots (ZMR), War Thunder, Nosgoth, No More Room In Hell, and Blacklight Retribution. Those are the only free games I have on Steam -
I love Vindictus!
Yo steam as hell ya AnarchWolfe if hat doesn't work AnarchWulfe
Love that game.
Bishhhhh Jack Falahee omg, did you just here my panies drop!
yasss boooh yaaasss
I only made it to season 2
I really like horro movies, I've heard of this series but never tried, is this good?
All horror movies are now remakes of something else. There is no originality and i can pretty much tell what the ending will be. Dissapointing... But i kinda am interested in more real life horror shows than fantacy movies that take the piss. When its based on real life it makes it so much more relevant.
if you look carefully you can find some very interesting gems in horror movies that are very unique
Do you have any recommedations?
Thanks, I'll check them out
I finished the Coven season last week!
I really enjoyed that season especially the cast. I reckon it could have been darker though...

Horror, Action, Comedy, Drama, Documentary, Sci-Fi? What is your favorite film genre?
I ABSOLUTELY love horror, blood, gore and all that. But I can enjoy a good comedy from time to time
Horror, but I can go with those cheesy children's animated films as well. Also, some "inappropriate comedy" movies.                      

Horrow, Thriller, Drama, Mystery, and Adventure c:
Comedy, romantic comedy, and mainly horror ^.^
My favorite movie genre would have to be horror
Psychological thrillers probably take the cake for my #1 film genre, I love a good plot twist. I also heavily appreciate Horror and Sci-fi films though.
Ugh, Gothic movies, the kind with some messed up romance and some kind of mystery involved. If not, something sinister and intriguing, but not too slow. I loved the movie Red Rover but I honestly can't find it anymore lol
Psychological Thrillers are pretty cool. Anything with some mindscrew to it is cool, anything like... Eraserhead.
Oh, also, Threads is a good movie.
to quote yahtzee and his zero punctuation episode of the evil within "horror horror and horror"
HOWLS MOVING CASTLE 
Sci-Fi
But I like a good comedy every now & then, they're easy to watch
Anyone out there on the vita?  If so anyone's free to hit me up for a game or just to chat my username is CuteDaemon (though I don't have very many games yet).

How about bleach? I mean half the episodes are fillers!
That's so right lol
Attack on Titan, bleach, naruto... even death note kinda. all the shit ones all the frilly weeaboos latch onto.
I started Attack on Titan last week and it's actually pretty intense. You should watch it before judging it. It's popular for a reason.
THEY'RE ALL OVERRATED
Why don't you explain how that's a fact and not just your opinion lol sorry but your tastes probably aren't as sophisticated as you think

Not saying I'm unique. I'm just saying, I'm not one for pop or anime. Not saying I'm SPECIAL for that or anything.
SERIOUSLY, YOU'S DO WELL IN THE PRESS. YOU DO ONE HELL OF A GOOD JOB AT MISREPRESENTING PEOPLE AND SUCH.
Come to think of it, as we're on the topic of age and such, is the really any point in criticizing a 14 year-old on trying to appear special or different?
fucking hell this is still happening?

I've used manic panic before, but used only one of their colors which was Vampire Red. I think it's really easy to use, but its fades quick.
Ok, and you just put it on, not mix it with peroxide?
No, don't mix with peroxide. It says it on the bottle/Jar too
Thanks! I recently got it dyed and the purple they used faded pretty quick after only two washes. And they did bleach my hair. It wasn't as light as I wanted it to be since I've had COLOR on top of color on top of color since none of the colors of done required bleaching since I couldn't have any 'crazy hair Colton' where I worked. But then when I started my new job in August and they said it was allowed. But I started with only a little 'crazy' color at first. And then went all out just recently. 
So when they bleaches my hair they had to do it twice to get it to be light enough for the purple to show. But still could've been lighter. 
So I'm thinking of buying just some purple and putting it in every once in a while. And maybe the blue that is underneath as well just to touch it up every once in a while instead of paying to get it done every few weeks since I'm not working anymore to focus on school.
I've been dyeing my hair since I was 7 (20 now xD)
I have always jumped back and forth between getting my hair done at a Salon or DIM with Manic Panic.
I recently switched to Splat when I learned a friend of mine never gets her done professionally and uses that product.
It comes with bleaching, the hair color and a comb. Though bleaching ones hair numerous times does do massive damage on ones hair.
Last year I got a chemical hair cut bleaching one to many and had to cut my hair boyish shoirt and let it grow out.
I live in Canada though and Splat/Manic Panic are the same price. If I'm not bleaching my hair. I'll go MP. If I am and I'm being careful/having someone do it for me. I'll go Splat.
I enjoyed it. I did the Red/Purple Splat. The red stayed for about one month even with my exessive washing every other day.
The purple faded extremely quick like within a week which I found unfortunately. I loved the vibrance 
Manic panic never worked for me. I have black hair so I needed a good bleach kit, (~$45) and then colour. Id bleach, wait a few days and colour, and a week later it was faded. I've tried green, blue, pink, red, and purple,before seeking another brand. 
I switched to Splat, which comes with bleach (for ~$15) and I had the colour stay vivid up to 3-4 months, (crimson red). 
Maybe MP wasn't compatible with me because I know others that it worked fine for others. 

One tip I can suggest for longer colour wear is to add a drop, maybe the size of a dimensional, to your shampoo. It refreshes the colour. Only downside about Splat, (not sure about MP) is the staining.
This is awesome but is the website reliable I mean it's not like a scam site or nothing rightand is the shipping reasonable? 
If so I might buy from them in the near future. :3
yeah it's more reliable that those wholesale site. just be warned the shipping might be a bit much.. but it is still reliable.
Thanks thats good to know and if the shipping is'ent to much I'll probably be shopping from them pretty soon. :3
Oh god I've been looking for something like this for so long! It's hard to find any pastel goth clothing in normal stores, and even then it's not usually what I'm looking for. Good resources are so rare ;n; thank you for this gift
No problem!!! D: i know the struggle. it's so frickin hard .
I've never heard of the terms pastel goth. lol. I'm getting old. But anyways, thats some cute stuff.
Hello! I'm Savannah! c: I am 14. Anyway, I also ask my mom, "Mom, if I pay for the makeup, can I start wearing black eyeshadow/eyeliner?" and my mom always says "No. I don't want you to be Goth." I never tell her that there are different styles. My grandparents think I'm becoming Goth just because I have teal in my hair. Can someone tell me if I'm too young to wear black eyeshadow/eyeliner? Or should I give my mom more time to think about the question? All comments will be appreciated!
It's hard to say if you're too 'young' to be wearing makeup as I believe everyone does things at their own pace, however.. here's an idea :)Maybe you can sit down and talk to your mom about makeup more. Quite possibly if you ask her to teach you different ways to apply the eyeshadow/eyeliner so it won't look too heavy or like too much to start off with, maybe she'll be more open to it :)
You're very welcome! I've been told that many times haha :)Well, a bit like the makeup thing, you may need to just sit and talk with her about it. Explain that since your hair is already partially teal, you'd really like to dye the rest of it. Maybe even go as far to explain how happy it'd make you to do so. Worst case scenerio, you could always dye your hair back to a more natural color so it shouldn't be too big of a deal :)
Thank you for helping me! :) Anyway, my grandparents think I'm Goth just because I got teal highlights about 4 months ago (which my mom let me have...) I don't mean to be rude...but how did you get your parents/guardian to let you dye your hair? I haven't talked to my mom about the makeup yet..but I'm going to wait until she's in a good mood. Anyway, uhm....my mom won't let me date...I mean..it's not like I am going to get pregnant or something...but..anyway...yeah. c: Wow...this has turned into a not-about-hair anymore topic! Haha... :) I hope you don't mind that I'm asking all these questions..and if you do..I'm so sorry and I won't bother you again.
You're welcome :) I don't mind you asking questions, I'm here to help!Well see.. I'm an adult, 20 and live on my own, I've lived on my own since I was 16.. so my mom has zero say in anything I do, nor does she even care xD so I was always able to do whatever I wanted, however.. being you are 14 & live under your mother's rules the best thing to do is just be respectful about the sitatuion and just explain all the reasons why you really want to do those things:) Sometimes parents automatically think the worst when it comes to things, so it's best to just talk it out & express the happiness it'll bring you..and just hope they understand :)
I gradually did it. I would go darker and darker each week and my mom finally just accepted it. I love makeup, and always have. And now I work as an independent presenter for a makeup company and sell makeup everyday! It is your face. Experiment and find what looks you like and perfect them, then those around you will accept and love your style because it's yours! 
I did the same thing as Shannon did. I just let it get darker and darker.
Although my profile picture isn't a good example, I'm not wearing make up in that one cx
Well if you're living with your parents, you can't do much other than sit down and talk to them calmly. My mom didn't like me wearing dark makeup, but after a while she agreed to let me wear it on weekends. As soon as I moved out, it was black eyeliner and bright red eye shadow every day.
I haven't gotten an emo haircut (layered with side bangs) since I was 13 and I wasn't even emo back then I just liked how it looked, and I really want to get another one this summer but I haven't found good reference images online. I'm growing my hair out and I want to get an emo style without decreasing the length. Any ideas?
Get dreads! ^_^
erm, I'm white, so that would be cultural apropriation.
I have dreads.... I'm white....
Lol I'm not sure what style I want out what color(s) so plz give suggestions.

I am fairly new to the emo realm and have no idea wear I should get my eyeliner or anything makeup wise for that mater or even what brand. Also any tips on music would help me severly as I am laking on music. Thanks. This is what i want the makeup to be like.

It really doesn't matter.. Just look up some or a tutorial and go from there ^-^
I share the same opinion as the tiny one.
Makeup isn't for feeling confident, it's foor looking cool. Thick black eyeliner looks metal as fuck.
BulletForMySilentSuicide said: Makeup isn't for feeling confident, it's foor looking cool. Thick black eyeliner looks metal as fuck.
You just made my point further.
If you care that you look cool or how you look, then you might LACK CONFIDENCE in yourself of how you feel. 

You don't get my point. There are people who are very confident but still wear makeup, for example pink lipgloss, because they love the color pink. Plus, putting on makeup is fucking fun. I like my bare face, I don't wear makeup on a daily basis but I wear black eyeliner to concerts because it looks badass, and sometimes it's fun to just put on a bunch of makeup and look like a barbie.
Plus have you thought of people who wear it for their job? Like drag queens?
SteFno said:

Makeup Artists are also required to wear it when they work.Who's going to get their makeup done by someone who isn't wearing any?Even us Freelancers have to wear it to get jobsPlus, makeup is makeup.I like being able to change who I am when I feel like itSometimes, I'm me and that's greatOther times, I put it on and I'm more laid back and relaxed.And then, if I want to be gay AF and wear everything pink and act like Barbie.. Well, I can.

Hi guys ^^
Two days ago i lost my emo hair((((((
I hang out on party and some assh*les shaved me bald((
So i got a question, how i can look in emo style without emo hair?
Maybe i need some ballcap or hat?
Thanks)
Wow, those are a bunch of assh*les! I'm so sorry they did that! I'm not good with hair and stuff, so I sadly won't be much help, but, you could always wear a beanie or something, I guess. Sorry, I' m not good at this.

Oh and also you can go to the police to report this...In the US it's assault and battery. 

That's what you get for looking gay in Russia xD
^his profile says he lives in Arizona, which I hope is true cause all gay and/or alternative russians should consider immigration
Beanies are helpful for covering a head. Some cosplay/costume locations have beanies with sewn on black hair sticking out for decoration.
Up until the past six months or so, I'd been using Manic Panic for all my dyeing needs. The problem with living in British Columbia (Canada) is that Manic Panic isn't the most available on the market. You can find it, it's just not nearly as common in drug stores or alternative shops. My replacement to remedy this dilemma was to switch over to Punky Colour. I do like the way it takes to my hair, and it lasts roughly the same amount of time (maybe even a bit longer) than Manic Panic. My only slight problem with it is that it isn't completely vegan. I felt a bit better knowing I was supporting a brand adamantly against animal testing and chemical use in products.What are your go-to dyes for rainbow colours? Preferably ones that can be taken off the shelf, not a salon brand/one that must be ordered.
i used splat when i dyed my hair. it worked way better than manic panic for me. manic panic didn't last as long in my hair as splat did.
Same! I've used Splat and it's pretty good, but I reccomend you can go get it done by a proffesional instead.
If you're worried about it being tested on animals, ask them! Probably not anyway ^.^
Try the ION dye. the aquamarine is amazing. i never had much luck with the pink.
N Rage also has really really good dye. [:
i use the manic panic hair dye, crazy colours even ones that glow under UV light (black light) they are very pigmented and easy to use :)
I usually use splat. (The purple in my profile pic is splat)
Arctic fox is really good it like manic panic but I lwrsytbi k it's better and also it is vegan and not tested on animals
avoid cassettes9 (etc he goes up 1 nr each acc)

cheers ds
heyyyy im sie and im new here
ok so i have snake bites and ive had them in for over 6 months but today in my regents my freaking piercing fell out and i lost it sooooo i waited till i go home and found ou it almost is all healed so i sparta shoved a labret in and now my lip is swolled like dufuq whyyyyy lol but has that ever happen to anyone?
It hasn't happened to me personally but it's pretty common lol
yea i dont have any face piercings (yet) but my belly ring fell out once and almost healed and i did the same so yea its normal :)
I wanna have Spiderbites but my mom won't let me! :(



Definitely band merch is such a blessing on this planet! Could never have enough band tees xD . Trust me, my friends would know, and even my own brother :p
EMO bride dress for emo girls

http://godma.bigcartel.com/ Hey check out my store and tell me what you think :) DISCOUNT CODE "ROCKSTAR"
Any guys that wear more than just eyeliner on here?Doesn't have to be to my extreme, just curious.
I do wear eyeliner but rarely more. Only for special occasion like halloween, I enjoy making my own makeup
Ahh okay, so not everyday use?Thank you :)
Nope not everyday use
Thanks ^-^
You kinda look like Violet Chachki!
I take that as a massive compliment, because she is gorgeous. Thank you :)
I feel like I want 2 where lipstick, should I?
If it's somerthing you want to do, go for itI personally wear lipstick quite a bit, in all different shades along with the rest of my makeup
cool





If you want fashion then go to the store, go shooping and buy some clothes or some accessories and then paid for them and you will haveeither EMO clothes or EMO accessories.
Or just look up stores online
Well nobody is perfect just to let you know XD ;)
My accessories I used to have about 10 pireceings  I had one on my nose still do 4 on my lips 2 each side  I only have 2 now and 4 on my eye brows 2 on each side go with what I did it takes time for the skin to grow back YA...

hey everyone,i was wondering how you guys spike your hair(preferably using gel or something like it) i dont have access to the pressy thingy(can't remember the name off the top of my head) so i would like something i can do with gel or other hair product. thanks guys and girls :)
Um there are good gel products. I use my dads XD what you do is you get a little bit and rub it onto your hands a bit. I get sections of my hair, hold it between my hands with the gel on them and quickly and messily rub my hair between my hands. Not up and down, sideways, like you're rolling something. Sorry I'm not good at explaining :( just try it and see if it helps. I hope it does~
My hair is stubborn so I use hair glue, especially when I had my Mohawk. What I do is put some in my palms and then rub it together enough just to spread it out. Then make sure you get close to the root of the hair and pull the hair into water direction you want it. Support the bottom more than the top, or its more likely to just fall over limp. Hairspray if you need the need.
ok so im updating my wardrobe and its basically just a bunch of super old emo/scene clothes from the early 2000s like hottopic n shit so if u have any ud like to sell in a bundle or give away (id pay shipping!) message me on here and send me pics of the stuff ahhh ! also goth/cyber/raver stuff is super cool too! n if u have like any gloomy bear or invader zim stuff i might buy that from u thanx a lot!! 
My hair is a bit short, I'm growing out my pixie. I already have sweeping bangs, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a style i could grow my hair into and color ideas for dyeing it? Something that would be good for my face and skin tone? Any ideas are appreciated Xp Xp 

Shave the whole thing
DylanDylan said:
Shave the whole thing
shaved hair is such a good underrated emo look, so is short hair
example


i think there's been a trend towards more expressive, longer, colorful, modified hair and makeup since the mid 2000s which is cool but i think that's sort of at the point where it's reversing. i dyed my hair in elementary and middle school when i was last really active in emo circles, and the younger emo kids at my high school tend to have dyed hair. but i never deliberately styled mine or did multicolors, extensions, clips etc. (little energy), and i don't see these kids doing that either. i've had natural hair for a while now, and i'm even considering getting some sort of Dykey-Butchy shortcut because i think that'll compliment my face better
^Personally, I think a cut like this looks great on almost anyone.
Such a familiar problem! I'm also very confused while thinking about changing my hairstyle :) at this time I have a great experience in this and can't stand from sharing with you guys some creative ideas even if this topic started long time time ago, suppose that this info will be useful for all forum members :)
Usually I search for interesting ideas on different sites for example last time I used a good article with beautiful photos I chose "blue pixie" the only difference is that my hair is much longer :) 

Yeah, I hear ya, it was mainly a phase for me, because I always had my long hair, now it's semi-short, I guess that medium length hair kinda style. I'll grow out the hair again, just not the eyeliner-phase again. :p
ha, do you bro. stay up and stay emo !!!
Haha ;D word bruh c:
Makeup is awesome on guys, but be careful on how you put it on :P
Hahaha :)
Make up on guys is amazing! I think it's hot personally, and a lot of others have the same opinion. Coming from a girl, guys should wear make up if they want to even though society may think lowly of it.
Yeah cx agreed, I mean I would, but I don't think I suit it anymore cx
completely support. but what about finger nail polish?
Nail polish is awesome too :) I'm a big fan of makeup :P
There is a forum post just on that I saw xD good look with the discussion!I use to do that via grade 9, fingerless gloves and made sure they were black fingernails :3
thanks bruh :)
I agree it doesn't matter what other people think if you like it go for it
I personally think eyeliner on guys is hot :3
Only a small percent of guys can pull it off. Personally, I dont particually like it. Except for special occasions. (like a show or concert or such)
I wear eyeliner sometimes not always and get lots of compliments but my parents hate when I do cx
I say do whatever makes you you and makes you happy ^u^Fuck the haters.
I think its adorable when guys actually do what they want with themselves, and not care what others think (so eyeliner counts!)
Guys that wear makeup? I think if they want to wear makeup then let them.... I aceept them... theres nothing wrong with a guy to wear makeup if they want
I definetly LOVE guys who wear eyeliner! *U*
i think its cute but its up to them because i personally think the sexyest thing a guy can do is be them selves and treat others with respect
I think makeup AND nail polish should be accepted on guys in the society as it is girls. It isn't 'gay' for a guy to wear makeup, have his ears pierced or have his nails painted AT ALL. (No offence to gays, I support them). I personally think guys look quite cool with their nails painted, eyeliner and both ears pierced. There is nothing wrong with it and any guy that likes makeup and nail polish has my full respect.

I think it looks great on most emo guys who r cute..
i think eyeliner on guys looks amazing :)
I think that eyeliner on some guys is really hot and sometimes it looks really bad but I have no problem with a guy if he wears it. It depends on how much you use and wear you use it (top or bottom of the eye) But I'm in a committed relationship with eyeliner and no one else can have my baby
I think guys that wear alot of eyeliner are cool, they are abble to share their style even though others might judge you. I call eyeliner on guys "Guyliner" Lol
I love it as long as they apply it correctly.
honestly love seeing dudes in all kinds of makeup
honestly hate seeing dudes
at all.
I love eyeliner and black nail polish on guys :')
i was just playin
idk i just distrust men and look down on dudes
boys can be cute and femme boys, sensitive boys are important and we should protect them if they express those sides of themselves
Do iiiit
I'll watch I'm still learning how to do make up I like yours
i need some ideas for looks to go for :o
Thanks :) yeah, i'd post a pic to help with the hair but i'm having technical difficulties so XP and yeah that helps a lot.
I love the 1 one
I love the first one the best
Okay maybe I will do the first one next month =)
cool I would like to see a pic after its done
Me too but It will take a while for me to get my new tablet beause it will cost more money than a hair dye but I'm tryinfg my very best to save up all my money and I will soon or later upload a photo of myself but it will maybe take months though
its ok
its ok
What is your favorite band? Why is it your favorite band? What made you like them so much? I wanna hear your guys thoughts! 
 

Opeth - one of the greatest metal bands of all time and easily the best band of our (1990 and onward) generation.
Drop Dead, Gorgeous - purely due to the nostalgia :p
Black veil brides
Sonata Arctica - The most beautiful lyrics I've heard in my life which also help you with a broken heart ^ ^
Leathermouth probably. :)
You guys all have amazing music!! Wonderful music taste!!
My chemical romance!  -They are amazing!!!
My favorite band is Motionless in White because their songs never get old, Chris does great vocals, the instrumentals are amazing, their songs are really catchy, and they play amazingly well live. I'm actually going to see them on Sunday when they play with The Devil Wears Prada, The Word Alive, Upon a Burning Body, and The Color Morale.
XxRebelAngelxX COOL!I also love em!And I totally agree about MIW's songs
One of my fave songs by them is" A.M.E.R.I.CA ",I dont know why but I love this song and  "Devil in the Mirror" mostly cause its the of their songs I heard
"Devil in the Mirror" cause it was the first song I heard by them
Oh that's cool ^.^ I can't choose a favorite when it comes to Motionless in White, but when it comes to Black Veil Brides, my favorite would have to be "I Am Bulletproof"
That's,same to me for BVB
I meant to say thats cool
Three Days Grace! :3
black veil brides ,live like a galass, avion roe'silverstain,snow white's poison bite and bring me the orizont
Pierce the Veil is one of my favorites
Ph thats so cool @kirashfflemo and @Aluetalovesbands
Slipknot or Five Finger Death Punch tbh :P

Well I don't know much about the Story. But I like them when they played with David Blade-Dickson. That's nice I wish I were there too. But I actually live in Germany. So it wasn't possible 4 me to travel over there haha
Black Veil Brides or My Chemical Romance
Pierce the Veil 
Asking Alexandria
Miss May I
Troubled Coast - Super catchy instrumentals that put a lot of feeling into the songs. All the guys in the band have superb chemistry and never play over one another. The lyrics are incredible, could honestly stand alone as poetry, and the way they're sung is always perfect. No other band can switch so seamlessly between screaming, singing, and spoken vocals.

Honorable mentions- La Dispute, Periphery, Silverstein, Saetia, and Lead Hands.
5. Black Veil Brides
4. Palaye Royale
3. Escape the Fate
2. Icon for Hire
1. Get Scared
My first favorite band is RHCP, so they'll always hold a special place in my heart, but following a line of thinking more relevant to the rest of you, AFI, Apocalyptica, Jeffree Star, Creed, Three Days Grace, and Rancid are also favorites of mine.
Probably motionless in white, chelsea grin, or thy art is murder
My Chemical Romance are my favorite band for a reason that is very dear to me. No they did not "save" my life like so many kids claim their favorite band did but they changed my life. I discovered them in january of last year when I was a junior. The entirety of that school year was hell for me, I was tired and very stressed 24/7. MCR made me get into music I never knew I would enjoy and all that music was a bright spot during the worst school year of my life. I may have discovered them after they broke up but they were my main source of happiness last year and I'm grateful. 

Definitely Black Veil Brides and My Chemical Romance!

BMTH, Pierce the Vil, Green Day, some russian emo groups like Dozavtra, Jane Air, Evo and my very favorite band is Nirvana
Follow My Lead = my ALL TIME favourite! Their songs are so relatible, and have that heavy rhythm I love! I recommend listening to "Jugular"
BORING
They're not your type of music therefore they are boring. Seems legit. We think bands you like are boring, doesn't mean they universally are. Paradox.
Well, no. Your bands are boring, it's fact.
That's not how music works my dude.
No, you're just delusional, m'lady.

Anyone who doesn't accept music as a whole and only chooses one band is boring you obviously uncultured human waste but either way arguing about this is really dumb beauty is in the eye of the beholder now go do something productive
Exactly. Music is relative, that's what's amazing about it. Let him be though, I was the same at his age.

You can't get basic grammar right, 130 charities is a dubious at best, and you call people fags online. You're lying, mate.
Heritage the company i work at calls and collects donations for 130 charities including the special olympics i do call people fags on the internet especially when they are being fags no like i said go get off ur ass put down the computer and get a job and pay taxes u are what is wrong with the world
Don't call annoying people fags. That's an insult to gay people.

Oh, Right! So YOU, personally, don't donate to charity, but you collect calls for a company that does! Gotcha. Collecting calls is a pretty pathetic job, mate.
I never said that i don't personally donate which i do i stated that i raise money for these charities and without my "pathetic" job the special olympic couldnt host of 200 games a day world wide ms patients would be in crippling debt kids with fatal diseases wouldn't get their final wishes granted but no my job is pathetic jesus christ ur argument has so many flaws its unbearable
Slipknot-amazing lyrics
My favourite is Fall Out Boy, they have such good music, it's really easy to relate to for me and I love them Coz they are just amazing
^do you like their old stuff or their new stuff more? Also who the fuck is ALT? Do you mean All Time Low?
Beartooth
Three Days Grace! Listen to 'Fallen Angel ,' 'Unbreakable Heart' ,  'Over and Over'

Those lyrics make me cry haha. I'm such a pussy.
A board for posting love songs :-)
 


I know a few "emo" bands that don't get as much attention as they should. 

-The Used. They are one of my favorites. They're a mix of pop punk and post hardcore and their lyrics are incredible. I discovered them through MCR (they did a song together). Bonus, their frontman is some seriously talented hot shit.
I could name literally dozens (not emo bands though) that almost everyone here have probabaly never even heard of that would probably amaze people if they gave them a chance. :3
*slowly raises hand* I don't know if they qualify as underrated, I don't keep up with their charts, but Wolfmother is kind of awesome?
um.
Evacuate The City?

Scarlett o'hara officially ended for good in December of 2012. Most of the members reformed into a new band called kliemax. I am still a huge fan of them and despite only releasing one album it was well received but they went on hiatus shortly after only to officially end the same year. Scary kids scaring kids actually got their band name from the song of the same name by the band Cap'n Jazz. SKSK broke up in 2010 sadly ;^; but it was a mutal thing as they all agreed upon it. Sadly the singer died of a herion overdose last year.
If we're going for underrated bands, then I'd say:
Gatherers - New Jersey screamo band with an awesome original sound
Saetia - an old school screamo band from 1997ish with incredible lyrics and great musicianship that was hard to find back then.
The Ongoing Concept - Metalcore band with a sound similar to Letlive. but with a very DIY ethic. They literally built the drumset on their new album.
The Venetia Fair - Crazy mother fuckers on social media with a sound that's like My Chemical Romance's Black Parade album on meth
Stolas - Proggy post-hardcore band that are all around amazing musicians and lyricists
Animals as Leaders - Very popular, but their guitarist is playing guitar in ways nobody I know ever has and could revolutionise music if anyone can replicate how he plays.
Entheos - The old drummer from AAL and my favorite bassist ever with a guitarist from their old band and an amazing female vocalist
Inferi - A christian technical death metal band with some sick guitarists and drummer.
Troubled Coast - One of my favorite melodic hardcore bands ever. Their Ive been thinking about Leaving You EP is a masterpiece.
Such Gold - Pop punk band that missed the whole pop-punk popularity wave with TSSF and Neck Deep although theyve been at it way longer and are incredible musicians with odd time signatures and crazy chords.
Owen - Solo project of a guy named Mike Kinsella. He was the drummer for Capn Jazz (where Scary Kids Scaring Kids got their name) starting when he was only 8 years old in 1989. He also played in about 30 other bands on every instrument.
Into it. Over it. - One of Mike Kinsella's good friends and band mates in other bands. He's also a solo-musician multi-instrumentalist with a more pop-punk style.
I'll try to think of more.
Sithu Aye - Amasing solo metal musician. He writes instrumental music thats gorgeous happy metal.
Chon - Mindblowing players who also write instrumental music. They were doing Dream Theater covers when they were 11 if that tells you anything about how great they are.
Plini - Similar to Sithu Aye and also good friends, but his music is a lot softer.
I also agree with Nurr and Pocky very much.
I know its not emo but the academy is is very underrated.
I didn't think the used were underrated...at least, I think they're pretty well known among fans of mcr and the like.

Famous last words is pretty awesome

Not really emo, more pop punk of anything, but the band As It Is
Angelmaker
Slaughter to Prevail
Till Death do us Part
Everyone check out Normandie

Do you love BVB for jsu tthier looks or who they are a t hear and their music? be honest...I love them for their lyrics are inspiring and have saved me so many times! It means the world to me that they can keep me alive and going somehow
bvb is shit and anyone who listens to them should consider drinking gene pool purifier.
My favorite band is Black Veil brides bcuz Andy biersack is my daddy
THE GOOD OLD DAYS XD. I remember the first song I heared from them x3 it became my FAVORITE!!! ^-^
Sure, because you're old enough to have a daddy.
LOL He's not really my daddy I said that 2 make others jealous
Literally nobody is jealous. You probably are, of Juliet Simms.
No I'm not jealous I do luv Juliet Simms n please get off my post if youre going 2 be disrespectful
I do not understand most Emo teenagers and their bombastic infatuation with Andy. He seems like any other person, and not a deity.
Any Biersack is just a person writing music 4 his solo album I just don't want anyone being disrespectful or thinking I'm jealous becuz maybe they r jelaous that Andy is married 2 Juliet Simms
Everyone needs 2 act mature and calm down
But you're not acting mature. Hypocrite.
I'm not bullying you
lol you actually blocked me. You don't have to be afraid of me though...I won't be a cunt to you, dox you or send you hate mail. Don't have time for that shit.
Leave me alone

Why would Ronnie be anyone's idol? He's such an awful person. Do you people not realize that?
^That's what I'm saying. He's almost as awful as Dahvie Vanity.
I Love falling in reverse, I kinnda like the old albums more though
ronnie os bae 
I love FIR omg! One of my favourite bands.
I listen to loads but my favourites are bring me the horizon, falling in reversem my chemical romance, pierce the veil and black veil brides
*reverse
I prefer Ronnie in Escape The Fate.
Tbh I only liked Falling in Reverse's first album. I personally don't base my opinion of the band based on the nature of the people in the band. The music is what really speaks for itself about the band.
I like bands they are like a source of letting go of yesterday
OMFG YESSSS
I love them. I hated them for a while at first, but now I'm in love.
I love them. I hated them for a while at first, but now I'm in love.

Dude, yes. Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties is such a tear jerker. Soupy is a damn narrative genius. When I found out the last song on the album was actually a Mountain Goats cover, it crushed my soul. I had been thinking the narrator and Dianne got back together but knowing it isn't his song, I'm not sure it's meant to be part of the story.

Neutral Milk Hotel is pretty rad.
Holy frick yeah, I recommend Girlpool. They're awesome
This is sorta like a poll to find the collective favourite My Chemical Romance album. Give your answer and maybe even why. As I get responses, I'll record the stats on this post.
We are talking about MCR!!All of their albums are awesome!!!Can't decide!! xc ...
Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge for me- there's just something about that sound c:. But Welcome to the Black Parade makes me feel freaking nostalgic.
Three cheers because it was basically my soundtrack back in high school
I'm into alot of different bands. I love more post hardcore bands more than anything so thats what im truly into and really into but i also like, electronica, alternative bands, pop bands, punk bands, like indie and stuff. I pretty much like bands in general no matter what genre. If your band is appealing to my ear than im going to like it. I wont judge it and say im not gonna listen to it because its too pop and ew pop (I dont like pop that much tbh) but yeah still i like the way some pop bands sound and their lyrics are genuine so whatever
my favoriat right now is davey suicide 
As long as it's creative and shows emotion it's good. I listen to everything from Explosions in the Sky to Infant Annihilator.
Shit, so many. When my emo/punk thing started it was just things like My Chemical Romance (first band I got into), Fall Out Boy, etc and as the months went by I discovered and got into new stuff, just recently into deathcore. My favorite kinds of bands are definitely alternative, post-hardcore, metalcore, and pop-punk. So it ranges from girly-ish rock like Paramore to loud stuff like Suicide Silence.
I listen to thrash/black/death metal, deathcore, old school rap, R&B;, pop, and reggae. It all depends on my mood. c:
I generally listen to hardcore music ,I mean I listen to metalcore(BVB,Asking Alexandria,Bulllet for my Valentine...),deathcore(FMS,BMTH)post-hardcore(PTV,Chiodos,SWS,Emarosa,Get Scared and more),emocore.I also listen to pop-punk,bands like ATL,Green Day and more.
Note:I listen to and am obsessed to many bands
I like:My Chemical RomanceFearless Vampire KillersFall Out BoyPanic! At The DiscoAll Time LowSimple PlanParamorePierce The VeilBring Me The HorizonBlack Veil Bridestwenty one pilotsGreen DayMisfitsBlink-182c:

And seriously, why the fuck isn't Tool on your list?
My favorite out of all of those are Blink-182 and Alesana.
I've heard of all of those, but I haven't really listened to a lot of them. I've always been more of a Placebo and AFI sort of "emo," but more than anything I listen to 90s grunge and a nice smattering of hardcore and punk. Bu of that list, I like Blink-182 and Puddle of Mudd. BVB brings me back to middle school, which is sort of... It's not a time I'm proud of. 5FD and Disturbed are great too. I apologize for being all over the place in this reply
I love most of those bands(: like shit man. I listen to them everyday. One question though, WHY ISNT GET SCARED ON YOUR LIST!!
i like peirce the veil, sleeping with sirens, all time low, asking alexandria, a day to remember, bring me the horizon, falling in reverse, black veil brides, and others too..
I love Alesana, I actually got into them when I was like 10, I had heard of them on deviantart when I was 9. So now I've liked them for I guess 6 years, and I've seen them 3 times since I didn't really start going to their shows until I was 14. I like a lot of other bands on here too, but hearing about Alesana is great c:
What is your theme song? Mine is Spirits by Strumbellas!
This doohickey right here.

Yep.
My theme song would totally have to be Crazy=Genuis by P!ATD
JinxGrey said: My theme song would totally have to be Crazy=Genuis by P!ATD
So how's that your theme?
Jumpin' Jack Flash of course xD
I was born in a crossfire hurricane..!
Dead bite by Hollywood undead
My theme song would be Karma Police by Radiohead.
Favorite band? and why?
Motionless in White, because they've been around for so long and each time I've met the band it's been a good experience. There sound is great and the lyrics are extremely creative. What I'm about to say is pretty cliche for most bands, but they've shaped me into who I am today, "Open your mind before your mouth", is what I practice each and every day and ever since the first song I listened to by them, I've been in love with that band ever since.
Ik call me crazy but I love ICP because there really relateable to me. They always had hatters and they simply just didn't care. Also not a lot of people know this but they actually help out and donate to the salvation army on a weekly basis and they don't hog all there money but give it to there parents and bought them there houses. They also talk about real shit that goes on in life. Ik I'm probably gonna get that one person who says that ICP sucks but I will respond to them IDC.
Tool - Sober? Ehh I don't think it has a sound of Marilyn Manson but it's a pretty good song cxAlso has a creepy vibe to it cx 

You might like em but ICP or even Twiztid. Tech n9ne and hopsin are also pretty good
The fuck is this shit?
"Skramz"?
"Emo violence"?
"Dark hardcore"?
SOMETIMES post punk?
Where did the good genres go?
The true punk?
The days of Descendents, Agent Orange, and the other great punk bands may be over, but it's time for the original punk to rise again
INK SOLDIER
@Noctem All of those bands have a place on a different label. Don't be a twat just because you like a different genre of music more.
I love black bowl bribes
I need new friends.. add me?

Okaii, so i love about every emo band there is xD, but i've never really been that into bvb, but isn't it crazy all the little horny girls like the band cuz of biersacks face and proabably dont even understand the meaning of the song? haha people these days..
BVB aren't actually an emo band
So I doubt you know every emo band in existence, bet you don't know who Hawthorne Heights are
Why can't we go back to the time when Papa Roach kept our hopes up we're to be loved and the day that i promised MCR I'm not okay, to the day breaking benjamin wrote about it in Jane's diary..all the way back when Yellowcard was my only one eventhough Three Days Grace hated everything about me.I still remember when Sum 41 was with me as we sat with Good Charlotte by the river just before Blink-182 came to say I miss you. Even Linkin park felt so Numb when Avril lost grip on all this.We the kings made a sad song because I was All American Rejects ,dirty little secret. Simple pan still thinks im perfect.*faints*~linkin park..wait
Don't wake me up yet..Greenday September has not ended yet..i miss those timesCan't Evanescence just bring these fallen angels back to life?
I'm into quite a lot of bands but I really wanna get into more. anybody have any suggestions?
It would help if you told us what genres you're into.

Randy Blythe accidentally killed a 19 year old fan during a concert.
We see them coming a mile away
Gathered to kill on the desolate plain
No fear in our minds
Pure hate in our hearts

Miscalculation of our strength their bane
Take us lightly and we'll make you pay
Pride left them defenseless
No mercy for Hubris

They rush to fight us and we stand and wait
Pulses quicken as they take the bait
Mere seconds to slaughter
We can wait no longer

Closing fast with their weapons high
Still believing it's we that will die
Now the ambush is sprung
Now they learn they were wrong
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart

They thought it would be easy but now they're being crushed
Arrogance of power leaves them dying in their blood
There will be no mercy for these filthy sons of whores
The innards of my enemies impaled upon my sword
Many years we've waited for this final day of slaughter
Our victims are decapitated, their limbs are torn asunder
Careful preparation brought our haughty victims down
Our forces are at full strength and the time to kill is now.

Time to kill is now

Time to kill

They are all dead, it's their end today
All lost their lives in tremendous pain
Not one has survived
We left none alive

Do not doubt our conviction to kill
Hate on our side we will never fail
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart
Strike the enemy down
The time to kill is motherfucking now.

No truth
But loss
A kiss 
From you
A blade
Of steel
My heart
To you
This blade

How to overcome depression


        My life is empty. Empty of love, action, family, and friends.
    Drowning in a river of emotions, pulling me out to a sea of isolation.
The cuts leak blood that increase the size of the sea
    The pills dissolve into the sea making it unable to sustain life.
    No fish and no birds, no plants left as far as the eyes can see.
But the pills don't help, the scars don't go away
       The scars are like an oil spill streaking through the water tpurple across my pale arms.
           A figure appears upon the horizon, a beautiful women with porcelain skin
She's perfect not thin

GETAWAY
the hooks are screwed to place, the nails hammered as hard as the walls can take.is the music pounding your ears?is it enough to cover the sounds?are the doors locked tonight, for the last time around.
ignorant child or ignorant parents?we're all ignorant to the pain we bring.it's not puberty, it's not a fucking phase.have they ever asked who owns the blades on the kitchen sink?
all you ever wanted was a hand to hold.a voice to hear, that isn't your own.not the voices in your head, nor the voices of the crowd.they don't know how it drives you mad when the silence gets too loud.
when the ropes are missing, when they start hearing tears.you take a step and forget all your fears.as each step you take determines your fate.and they rush to your room for all is at stake.but by the time, the last step, you make.you've always been dead inside, so it has always been,
too late.
Oh twilight-- As I try to rest,
Though I twist and turn,
You still mock and jest
And yet still Inside I burn
Riddles crash inside my mind
Silent screaming skies
What's thou I cannot find?
What heart knows but mind denies--
A love beats within my breast
With silent lips yet still I lay,
Coward's heart in my chest
Lest be troubled til comes day;
Oh love within my beaten heart--
Mend my soul with petals soft
Though are angel and art--
Dreams of you come oft
But fade like summers nights 
Wishful dreaming as it may be
Now beneath heaven's lights
I drift to dream; of you and me.
More to come, maybe.
Pretty kwel
Thank you!
No problem
I like the cats. Very pastel goth ish.
COOL :DD
Thank you.

awesome.
your work is fantastic
thanks :D realy appreciate it most see my work to "hardcore"
yeah well most are cunts.
i really like your work, you're not bad at drawing and sketching as a whole, i can see that. i like the way you've only used red when it's needed, it's not over the top and the lack of other colours really makes it pop.
i like the actuall drawings too, i think they're sick. keep it up
thanks! :D awesome to see that there is till people who hasnt subscribed to the bs that is todays mainstream nickiminaj 1direction and the other totally bland copypaste pop culture bullshit :D i usually get looks of "are you allright in the head?" realy nice to find people who appreciate my work :)
Wow, you're extremely tallented! Very impressive work. Even if people think it's morbid no one could deny that you have a lot of talent.
Thanks yeah they say kinda that but  allways add"but you shouldnt draw that its not healthy" but i draw best when im upset and angry or otherwise emotional :) and this is a couple of examples of what comes out on the paper ;)


Amazing stuff. You could get paid to draw album covers for death metal bands.
thanks! :D the most awesome compliment i have gotten ever! :D
JESUS CHRIST YOU'RE AN EDGY CUNT.
haha that trolls second acc banned xD
Yup.
made this now i got pretty satisfied with the result :)
That's not his second account banned, it's his fifth. The staff of this site can't figure out how to ban IP addresses.
thanks and yeah i noticed that 100% of all his crap was negative slandering and ripping on people in various ways, its pathetic that he has that little to do in his life that he can sit and make fake account after fake account he must be a very sad and pathetic individual
He's 13, he probably doesn't have much else to do.
It's pathetic that you waste time feeding trolls after they explicitly tell you they're taking the piss. 
Well are you a troll or a kid who gets off on being an asshole? Make up your mind, damn
Nah.

I'm new and I'm only ok at drawing what do u think
^posting your art would help us in deciding that
wow thats sooo good
thanks :)

made this tonight at 4 in the morning, my brain works sooo much better during the night :D

made this awhile ago and put it up in my neighbourhood because islamic crimes is a huge problem here...they got taken down in 2 days :(

made a new one tonight...or should i say morning its 4 in the mornign here now :p
haha this made my day xD
and the camp councelors are veeeery proffessional and just lovely huh ;)
Could I post something? And I like the one with the grim reaper and the city.
Yeah your more then welcome Nope :) art should be free to all!
just make sure you say in the description its your own, wouldn't want to take credit for your hard work :) 

I've changed my mind. I haven't a clue how to post pictures
Oh fairenough well if you change your mind, you can email me the pictures you want to post i don't mind.
ms kassidykillz :)
I would just say focus on your proportions, the way I learned it was to pick a part of your drawing to use as the measuring stick for the rest, try to pick something that could fit into the other parts equally
Thanks Kolvx sounds like good advice, are make sure I try that on the next one.
yeah i agree with kolvx and dont ever look at it as a whole so to speak, think of an anatomy doll (you know those everyone had in artclass) that is a very simple way actually to learn proportions and make it look natural :)
Emo couple!

Hey my bf and I are emo can I send a pic
So cool this makes me wish i had a emo bf or just a bf really XD

Out of space the queen of the sun Shone brightly as soon as she gazed upon Igloo icy figure that was the prince of ice their eyes met and it was an instant attraction they tried for years and years to get close to each other but only to fail and for every time they tried to kiss the queen of the Sun would go out and the prince of ice would. Melt and when they finally realize that their love could not be the queen of the sun go inside the Sun to burn for all eternity and the prince of ice froze his self never to Breathe Again the only way they could live for all eternity

If you want to write something like that, for fuck's sake, learn to use some basic grammar first.

If you're so uncreative as to be unable to come up with some simple charcaters, you're almost certainly going to churn out some pretty shit stories.
Well thank you so much for your input ^-^
Give up, mate.
I'm sorry.

you just don't wanna see.

I'm thinking about making a new book on my wattpad.

How is that possible? 
If I do it, who wants to be in it?

avoid cassettes9 (etc he goes up 1 nr each acc)
he is a troll who gets of on pissing people of and thus as a bieffect also flood commentsections do not even respond or pay attention to anything he may say no matter how offensive dumb or in any other way provocative it may be
cheers ds
I knew he was a troll thanks
Dont touch fire! that shit'll burn you yo!
Why did you make 3 same topics ?
We all know that. You're only feeding him by posting this. Nice job.
and the only thing that a troll cant stand is silence so now that i know that he is a troll and i wasted alot of time on him i thought since i saw him attacking newcommers who do not know he is a troll to give them a headsup
That is thoughtful to think of newcomers like that C:

Kota Dear, It's Gr8. But I Just Want To Tell You This; The Jews & Christians Believe In The Same God Yes, But The Christians Believe That Just As The Story Goes, God Has Already Came. The Jews Believe He Hasn't Come. But He Will In The Future. That Is All.
Its Jesus and I know I messed that up
The Character Doesn't give a fuck so yeah
Oh and I took this on the lake in front of my old house this summer.
another pic I took this summer 

Hey! So Ice wanted to start a YouTube channel for a while, but I have no idea what I want to do on it, like. I'm okay with makeup, I'm kinda funny, and I'm a bit of a dork. Do you guys have any suggestions for what I should do? Also I'm new to the website !
Just do vlogs. You can talk about topics you think are interesting and know about, or things thAt you Don't know all that much about but have input on.
O...m...g... That blue skull and rose one is drop dead gorgeous. I love all of them but that one is just wow.
Yeah that one took forever i put in alot of time into doing it and making sure the colors were right. After doing it uploaded into my drawing tablet sofware and sharpend it . Should finished the others but never had the time to do it.
Damn, you're drawings are epic. Ever considered becoming a tattoo artist? Seriously looks like you have the talent for it. :3
Oh...G...A....W....D THIS IS EPIC!
Fucken mean. Love it
hi here is a set of tattoos i made on myself with a johnny irons machine and alla prima paint (the guy in gasmask and helmet was my first selfmade had to do it upside down so i am happy with the outcome i have outlined so you can see them better)
Them tattoos look so cool:)
thanks! :D appreciate it :3
your welcome:)
wow.. you made it yourself. you and those tattoos are cool!
Thanks never been called cool before haha :D  awesome that you likey haha :3
Not bad man :D You got some skills!
thanks i "train" on myself to get better but since i have been drawing since i knew what a pen was its just like holding a heavier pen with an engine :3 so its going pretty good :D
Same :) Why buy pig ears from the butcher when I've got a walking blank sheet right here? Hahaha ^_^
haha exactly what i said well i said "i rather buy some new gasmask or various tattoo equipment than buying the skin of a dead pig or synthetic skin" so my skin works fabulously and i have a suspisiously skyhigh pain threshold (it proves very interesting during more intimate activities haha ;D)
Fair play ^_^ Haha
I just said "well there will do" xD
haha yeah i kinda get some impulse some days/night where i could be sitting watching vikings and suddenly my adhd mind kicks in and tells me "hey wouldnt a badass tattoo be just awesome to make right now! " haha oh adhd u so silly and sometimes pretty annoying but mostly its nice :3
So we have decided to add the quiz feature back to the site again. I think it can be fun for everyone. You can create quizzes by follow this link http://emowire.com/quizzes/create
My rank actually dropped, by 100, why?
I didn't get 1,000 extra credits .-.
Neither did I .-. Haha
Never got mine either... :(
heh heh Lucky me :P
How about me?
Never got any either ;-;
I didn't either. And where exactly is there a place to spend them?
Yes I read that you are supposed to spend them to give another member something. Where is the store that it mentioned?
I'd like to know about the store too.
At this point, I've given up on credits.
I still don't even know how you're really supposed to use them -_- had no answers about this store thing so far.
Yeah. When is that store coming in hmmm? :| been awhile since we've heard anything about it.
So you're expecting relpies from Truth? Wow, that's dumb.
Not really XD
Yep, it is.
Uploading youtube video is working again!
Can you make it to where we can upload video files?
Pls
Sorry as of right now we dont have enough resources to actually host uploaded video...as it can slow down the site. Definitely in the future if possible.
Hi everyone,
It comes to our attention that the upload youtube video does not work on emowire at this time. We are working to fix the problem. The annoucement will be made in this forum once the problem is fixed. Sorry about it guys!
Hi everyone,
Emowire's server is being scheduled for update on 4/20/15 between 1:00AM and 2:00AM CST. You may not have access to the site for about 10-60 minutes.
Sorry everyone. We have disabled the chat box temporarily as it might have consumed much of the server resources and slowed down the site. You can still contact your friends using Private Message system on the site. You can also visit the public chatroom as well. Sorry for about this.
It's quite upsetting though.
What is this public chatroom you speak of, all I see is blank unless I have the person as a friend...
Emowire wasn't like that before...
Thanks for posting this as many members are not familar with CSS :-)
it's no problem i know i was clueless when i first joined so i had to make my own judgements on what sites were safe and would work effectively (:i hope this helps them
Thanks this really helped a lot. :3
CSS video tutorial here is the link for the video tutorial i did i hope it helps those that didn't understand

omg thank you i posted a pic a while back asking for someone to help me put it in css my old account dont ask how but i got a deadpool gif from the game to repeat in the background but i swear i did the same things this time witha diffrent gif and it didnt work so thank you
i did it omg thank you so much *hugs everyone * yay markiplier with fish teehee
Gaaah thanks so much for this! It really helped ^-^
I am still so very confused, I guess I will have to figure it out
Thank you for trying to help new/frequent users. c;
Omg this helped me sooooooooooo much
I just used basic HTML. It worked for me. Rofl.
Where did the instant messaging feature go? Could you, the admins, possibly bring it back?
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
I have alot of requests but no way to accept them
but just ask him if you need help
I hope your problem have been solved.
If you're on mobile then go to the bottom of the page and select "Full Site" and wait for it to load and you'll see a red "Notification" tab, select it and then go to " View All Updates" and accept any friend request!
I keep trying to send messages to people and it won't work cause it says I'm not filling out the "Send to" section and I'm typing the person's username correctly am I doing the wrong way or do they have to be on the friend list first or something else?
Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
DamienAnderson said: Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
+Or in your inbox, click on Compose message then type the user name of the one you want to send message to and the rest is obvious !
But what if there isnt the''send message''thing under their profiles?
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
i have the same problem,but the''send message''thing isnt there.
mine keeps saying that i need to add a persons name i did that but it says that theirs no one of that name
i wrote a lot but w.e
I second all of this, especially chat. I'd love to have an instant messaging feature where you could have your own group chats, and even different (and maybe custom) chat rooms would be great.
just make emowire exactly like oldschool myspace hahahhaha thatd be the best
Add video chat too
I will personally delete the account and ban the account. Please send me screen shots of the conversation to me in private message.
How do I delete my account?
post pictures of penis getting punctured with needles
go into settings.
why delete?
Alright, so, everytime I got to hit "accept friend request", I get this text here. I know you can still visit people's profile,andaccept there, but it's a bit annoying. Especially when you have to accept a lot of requests at once. It's easier just to click the "accept" button, and continue on. Once again, I know I'm not the only person with this issue, since I think I've seen a few posts about it.
I don't get friend requests so I can't relate
It's a issue for example everyone I do believe. There's a lot of things that need fixed but just don't seem to get done. Kinda feels like they just don't care about the site much or fix ongoing bugs...
Thank you SuicideSheep for reporting the this bug to us. The problem has been fixed.
Thank you!
I would like a better chat room on here, with pannel and shit and room to private chat and stuff and shit
What does that have to do with this?
nothing :( I'm just asking stuff
Lmao that was hilarious
was to lazy to make a new thread so I just starting talking in this one
Lol the way she responded was gold
Problem fixed so topic closed guys :-)
Sounds great.
Something we have to reconsider. Maybe Soundcloud embedment or something in that sense

This is what happens everytime I try to view any profile, and from what I understand, I'm not the only one with the issue.
you need to click on Updates and that shows you the profile
^...no, updates only shows your notifications. She says she has visited other profiles and they all had nothing on them. 

Vampire is right click on "updates" and it will solve your problem not the updates that is in red when you get notif but the "updates" next to friends, albums and other shit.
Thank you for reporting. It's fixed now.
Thank you.
is there a way to tag people on here
No. This isn't facebook.
lol haha thought that too
Yeah we dont have that feature
okay thx ^^
Hello very sorry to bother you all but I have a quick question regarding Group membership requests. Is there any way possible the site could automatically delete, deleted members' membership requests? I have atleast 2 or 3 and its making it harder to get to approving others since its in the way and everytime I go to reject it to get rid of it I get an error code.
So I heard there was a store on here... How do I get there?
I wonder the same thing everyday... XD
i contacted Emowire & asked them.. hope for a reply soon enough
What up wabbit
No not me though
Are you gonna ask the Truth about this? I'm sure that he can help with this problem
It worked out after I shifted to firefox from Chromium.
I'm guessing that this is a little late, but Emowire glitches on everything except Firefox for me anymore. It used to work on all, but not anymore. Maybe that's what happened to yours?
Have you tried to block that member?
He can't view my profile page anymore so yes He was blocked earlier today right before I took a break from this site
Great...topic closed
This site should also be app for androids and iphones
Sorry but there is no roadmap for app. We are trying to make the site accessible by everyone and this site also have the mobile version of itself
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
You have to be friends with someone in order to send message
From what I remember, they're not allowed. She has multiple nude photos but I doubt they are her own pictures.
Have you tried to unfriend and block that person before posting in this forum?
Topic closed
I just updated my status only for the text to copy 4 times over, like really? Idk if anyone has experianced this apart from me. Anybody have a clue?
The chat feature is working properly. It's because people dont go to chatroom; most members still preffer private messaging of the site.
Ok, thanks Monster.
