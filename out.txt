I'm kinda new here. I've been a member for about a month and have only visited twice, I'm mostly on Facebook or Messenger. If you want to message me, my name is Dami Adams, user is Dami.reaper. 

There's not a lot that you NEED to know about me. I'm pretty easygoing. I like writing stories, poems, and songs, reading, or listening to music in my free time. I listen to everything and I read a lot of horror. Horror movies also get me going, 

I'm single, but I'm only here to make friends. I don't really care for relationships. I prefer  to be single and just flirt around honestly. I don't have the time or patience for failed relationships. 

I want to become a writer someday and travel the world. Other than that, I want to start my own family. 

You know a bit about me now, so just shoot me a message I guess. Don't be boring and don't be cliche. Peace xx
I feel you on the realationship stuff. Flirting is way to fun to quit. Not that anybody flirts with me.

Hello cx
Oh hi my name is Shane from Texas. I have joined this site cause I'm very lonely and need a friend in my life. I am 17 years old and my favorite bands are Fall Out Boy, Sleeping with Sirens, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots, Blood On The Dance Floor, and of course Black Veil Brides the band that saved my life :D lol.
No wonder you're lonely, your tastes in music are shit and you say "Rawr" spontaneously.
Oh wow that exactly the opposite I wanted out of this, good job you just added another cut. And Black Veil Brides got me to wear I am today and has taught me a lot and made me consider not suicide
You needed Black Veil Brides to get you out of suicide? That's fucking pathetic, man.
This isn't how I wanted it to be at all, you guys are really triggering me
Also if you talk about Blood on the Dancefloor on this site, don't get offended when I tell you about all the horrible shit Dahvie Vanity's done. Calling him out is something I love to do, mostly because he's not in jail yet. It's a shame to still be a BOTDF fan at 17, honestly. 

Im 18 from Indiana. Im just looking for some cool friends to gain!
Or, Bullet, just listen to some fucking Brand X.
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
It's not true, Dahvie is my hero
Hi BlackBlade ^_^ Hope you're doing well :3
Look at this garbage. THIS is what you are supporting. This is the man you call your hero. I need to you think real hard about what it is you see in him.



Don't tell me how to live my life faggots. Dahvie is a great inspiring guy
Nothing about him is inspiring, he's a bully. But hey, don't say I didn't warn you when you're at a BOTDF meet & greet, being forced to give Dahvie head in the back of their tour bus.
"better person" This person is calling me a faggot for being honest and caring about them lol they're not a "better person"
Look ,I know what he called you but you really can't change his opinion.I'm not taking any sides but ...how can I say this? That's his opinion and we can't make him replace it with ours if he doesn't want to.
I really am trying to think of things about Dahvie that might be positive; but it's clear that the only reason emo and scene kids like the guy is because he defends them and says it's okay to be "different". Then to the people who aren't "different" and call him out on his bullshit? "I would love to push you down the stairs you cunt brick!". So inspirational right?

It's not ,I know.I've discovered Dahvie and BOTDF when I was 15-16.I know that he isn't a sensitive person and I know that he's rude towards people.
I agree that few of the songs that he has are pretty funny but if I have to fully agree on something with Shane is about Black Veil Brides because Andy really is an ispiration.At least that's my opinion.
I personally like their music, not a big fan of them. But who cares, becuase its all about the music so everyone shush 
What kind of films do you like?^-^
I like sci-if to ^-^
Hello :33

Hi :3
Hai cx, How are you doing?
What's up?
Uh, hello..
Hello
Hey! I am new to Emo Wire. I simple adore metal and rock and obviously, BLACK. I am an introvert but I am free online :P I have no piercings or tatoos. And mostly! I LOVE ANDY BIERSACK 
ugg's make me wet.
Hello
I'm very bored and new to the site. I want to make friends and not many people are accepting my friend request, I want to find someone to talk to (: i'm very friendly and easy to talk to so please dont be afraid to chat with me.
Hi gaynigga :D
hello :D
bro go sip lean
i bet thatll help
Hey there peoples. Name's Jack and I mostly came here to read any interesting perspectives. Being an introvert my whole life has led me down a relatively strange path. Everyday filled with self-analysis, my view of our reality has gotten to a point where I'm not sure if it can change anymore. So I plan to pan through and see if I find any interesting minds. 

Hello :3
Hello. You're a pretty attractive fellow.
Hi there Nimda, lol and thanks Soleil.
hey my name is james im new on here looking for any single emo or non-emo girls would want to talk to me. 

Heyo! My name is Caitlyn (feel free to give me a nickname if you want xD), I just joined and I'd love to talk to some cool people! :3
I think I'm cool :D so what's up?
Haha hey! ^_^ I'm doing good, just mentally preparing myself for school tomorrow. What'd up with you?
Hello :3
Hey! :3
Just finding awesome people like you to chat with!
Haha sounds fun :P
Hi my name is Jess and I'm new to this website, and would love to make some friends. Sooo just comment heh c: 

Hello! =3
Nimda said:
Hello! =3
Fuck off filthy nigger
hey therand welcome
hi :D
Hey I'm Brandy! Nice to meet you! I'm looking for friends and people to chat with. I love anime and uh... horror stuff I guess.
You show no dominance, what a faggot.
I'm not a pile of sticks, thank you very much. But yes, I am gay. Thank you for pointing that out. Have a wondrful day!
Pans tho...pussy.
Did I say you had a pussy? No, I called you one. Stop trying to act smart when your shit doesn't even make sense. Another "unsure" 18 year old. Faggot is a durragatory term towards people like you. You act stupid, I'll treat you like you are. Fuck outta here.
That's not very nice nor mature. And I will not. You do not control me. I control myself. I am a boxer. I take care of myself. Now please leave me alone, sir.
How is it less mature than acting like an idiotic child? Who cares if you're a boxer? Isn't that a poor white man's sport? And taking care of yourself by losing fights and getting your ass kicked...right. VERY smart. Also, your sentence structure in itself tells me you don't take care of your mental health. I'm not controlling you, I'm treating you a certain way. So, maybe think a little next time, big man.
I do have schizophrenia and autism, my good sir. I don't get my ass kicked because I don't do competion. I only fight if I have to protect myself. So please stop treating me the way yoy do because it's not very mature or affective, as it does not make me concerned. I reported and blocked you. Please leave me alone now, because I have more improtant buiseness that talking with an imature brat like you.
Autism is obvious, your intense paranoia shows you're more unstable. Hope the Psych ward is having a sale, bc bitches like you needa be put away or put down. You aren't really a boxer if all you do is "fight". Do you hit with your wrist? Like normal kids with autism do? Autism doesn't compensate for your poor english. How am i being immature? I'm just being honest, pal.

it's actually a very old picture that is on internet so stop making a whole bunch of unnecessary drama about it, there is no owner of that picture since it's unrightful from google
Dude just go. This isn't you. Give it up.

Hey Sophia
Hello people. I'm Toni. I'm 18. I am looking for some friends. I had an account before and deleted it.
Get to know me. (:
Kik : misaki.Senpai
Snapchat: paleghostbitch
If you add me on either, you have to tell me who you are and how you got my username. (for snapchat you must send a picture with your first and last name.)

Vampire freaks: paleghostbitch

That's all (:
Welcome back.
You look extremely familiar and I have no idea why. lol.
I used to have an account as "necromancermango" i think i deleted it but idk. I wasnt very active haha
hm. I might have just saw you then haha
Haha probably. I promise I'm not fake. I can even skype anyone that thinks so.
Thats funny actually. That was one of the first things I thought. Usually overly cute people are fake. But nah. I believe you =].
AW YOU THINK IM CUTE THATS SO SWEET. Ive never been faked actually. Haha.
Proud of u. It is good emo porn
Sorry but why are you watching porn? You're a child.
BulletForMySilentSuicide said:
Sorry but why are you watching porn? You're a child.
REKTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Triggered much? I'm genuinely concerned as to why you'd watch porn, as your profile says you were born in 2003. Like damn. Would you get offended if someone told you not to cross the street when there's cars passing? I'm pathetic, but you're the one wasting your time on porno at 13?                      

I'm not trying to offend you, you're just getting unnecessarily offended, my guy.
This is basically the definition of "I'm different than others my age!!! I'm so mature!!!"
Get a joke? I don't watch porn. I was just pointing out how you repeatedly comment on anything I post like you have nothing to do. I'm not triggered, just annoyed. And no, I am not claiming I'm different from anyone my age or more mature than them. Thank you.
If the reason I comment is that I have nothing to do, then the reason you make these posts in the first place is that you have nothing to do.
Amputee porn... Seems legit :llll

5 seconds in and some 48 gender fag is 1) still alive and 2) already blocking. You're 13 and have no idea what the fuck life is. you're just mad that your fire crotch cunt can't get anything but another fat taco to bump with you. I may say this a lot but this is very genuine when I tell your "male" faggot ass to kill yourself...please do it now. and at least you can creamate yourself because that fire on your head and pussy is burning you already. so...kill yourself. 14 years in and already not worth it JFC.
Who is it?
You, fucking cuck. Carrot top bitch. You literally are using an old photo. I understand you are stupid (because you think there are more than 2 genders) but I'm not you, and not stupid. You are so pathetic. Honestly, leave and never comeback. The DB shows you deleted your acc and made a new one 5 min later. so stfu you 14 year old twat.
Think ya have the wrong person m8. There are more than more than two genders. Girl, boy, both, neither. Easy.
Listen boy/girl I don't know who you are talking about and why you are so triggered by the fact that there are more than two genders but keep me out of it. I just found this website today and I would rather not get spammed with something I'm not even apart of. Byebye.
top ramen looking ass. there are only two genders, the rest is either mental disorder or wanting to look unique or both. you need some dr. paul r .mchugh in your life grow the fuck up and read some facts.
WHEN SHE TRIES SO FUCKIN HARD TO NOT BE HERSELF BUT WILL NOT ADMIT THERE IS ONLY 2 GENDERS. LMFAO THIS BITCH NEEDS TO KILL HERSELF. WHAT A WASTE OF LIFE LMFAO.
I'm just gonna go I have no clue what is happening, you have your own mental problems that you need to solve.
says the one who has gender identity disorder.
^ TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Title says it all. Discuss?
He was just hungry for power.
So what you're saying, is he wasn't a bad guy, just hungry for power?
It's justa point of view, really.For some he was bad and for others good

Seems like a great guy to me.
Hitler is daddy 
well if you want a real answer you must first take a long hard look at how ww1 ended and start there, after ww1 germany had to endure one of the most terrifying and humiliating times in world history they had nothing the reichmark was worth nothing due to france demanding ridiculous sums of money for war reparations and when germany couldnt deliver the massive sums france helped themselves so to speak and took the coalmines in the ruhr, berlin was the cesspit of the world in the 1920s anyone and anything could be bought, sexclubs with children as young as 10-11 was all over berlin and perverts from all around the world stormed to berlin to capitalize on germanys hard times, and its in this era when germany is so morally bankrupt that hell itself would blush that the NSDAP takes form and gains strength from families who had to sell their daughters not even in their teens to old perverted men from all over the world just to get by each day and its these very ppl who wanted change more than anything else and that is when adolf hitler came into the picture (and as they say desperate times calls for desperate measures) so there where streetfights every day in berlin amongst other citys the farleft (the spartacists) and the far right (freikorps consisting of soldiers and veterans of ww1 still itching to fight for germany) fullscale civil war was a fact and part of daily life in germany inthe 20s and by night berlin was riddled with sin of the most diabolical kind and its in this cesspool of pervertedness and horrifying shit that hitler started to gain support by the thousands every day, so when the election of 1933 rolled around hitler won and promised to change things and he did he even chose to put up a NSDAP headquarter in a former pedophile sex club in berlin jsut to make a statement that things where going to change, and they did adolf hitler got rid of the massive unemployment problem and gave the people statefunded vacations (something that no other nation did during this time) and built several wonders such as the autobahn germany soon was no depraved state but a flourishing superpower and all this he achieved in 4 years so i have seen many old people from germany who to their death supported adolf hitler and said to those who asked how they possibly can think hitler was a great leader to this day that "you where not there you cant possibly understand the hell we lived in before hitler saved us" and since im a socially awkward emotionally detached individual i can see the germans from that times reasoning and i understand it even, its true we today cant possibly understand the horror that was germany after ww1 and to them hitler was a hero a saviour who saved both germany and the german people, im not promoting hitelr here dont get me wrong im jsut saying that there is two sides to every coin and furthermore this is the short version the story of hitelr and his rise and support is a long and complex one
TL; DR. ^
if it is then why ask such a complex question? i just tried to answer an enourmous question and that will be long.
Didn't ask it, not my post.
ok but why even remark that its to long when you know that question is extremely complex? and demands a long and thorough answer?
Used his power for evil. Yes, he was a bad guy.
It didn't REALLY require an input, it's a sarcastic questioin, because he didn't do anything wrong. I don't need a lengthy answer because I know my thoughts. As for witchcraft wife, you're most likely a jew

Still a rat though. An idiotic piece of shit tbh.
Hitler = Keemstar on a political scale.
so im gonna put up a thesis here that INSANITY is it formed over time or something you are born with?
so i have been thinking a long time that for example when shit happens alot it takes a toll on the psychee for example sweden where i live our politicians are so so so disconnected from reality that the entire left is infiltrated by islamists, militant islamists and when i was a little kid i witnessed on the news the killing of a politician named anna lind she was killed by an insane man who just went to one of her meetings in a mall and just stabbed her and he was declared insane, was this man insane by birth or driven to it by the madness that is todays society? and are the politicians realy that naive to think that when they make decisions over the ppls heads the ppl will just shrug their shoulders and pretend like nothing has happened? like its not a big deal to bypass the fundamentals of democracy, i for one think that insanity is osmething one can be driven towards out of necessity formed out of the current situation so in other words some forms of "insanity" is just a case of "desperate times calls for desperate measures" like just think about how many people right now as im writing this sits at home just boiling of hate towards the sitting government and just think how many of those millions of people actually are capable of doing something about it it doesnt take much, all you need is a kitchen knife and to have reached boiling point, do these "democrats" realy think they will get away with it just because they make the decisions, history has shown us that you cant rule a country without the people on your side, so again insanity is it born or formed over time
It depends. It can be about how one was raised. Osama Bin Laden was raised by a Muslim extremist, so he became a Muslim extremist. But I don't think Hitler was raised by fascists (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not very knowledgable on wwi/wwii history)

Do I even want to try to comprehend what is happening here?
What's the big deal here? There's people a lot more fucked up than her
I'm sorry but people who self-diagnose mental illnesses are kinda making things a little harder for those of us who were profesionally diagnosed. I'm in a few discussion groups for people with mental issues and we're targets for harassment from idiots who accuse us of making up our problems for attention.

It's also pretty annoying to see people on tumblr self-diagnosing themselves with long lists of mental illnesses. I'm pretty sure it's not possible for people to have both autism AND aspergers...
UHM EXCUSE YOU I HAVE DEPRESSION ANXIETY PTSD BIPOLAR DISORDER DIMENTIA AUTISM ADHD SCHIZOPHRENIA OCD I HAVE EVERYTHING I TOOK A TEST ONLINE I. AM. MESSED UP. XD i totally agree with you. if you self diagnose then go to a doctor and make sure so you can help ^-^ but girls nowadays think its cute to be extremely fucked up.
The worst is when kids on tumblr think you can get PTSD from online harassment
yep agree on that i was diagnosed with adhd, ocd, ptsd, bipolar disorder and aspergers when i was 14 and have since went to 9 different psychiatrists and behavioural therapists and i get a bit ticked of when i see people whine about getting ptsd from online bullying and say that online harassment is the same as physical and psychological bullying irl because their version of bullying is countered by doing as follows...TURN OF THE PC! when irl bullying is well its irl so you cant get away unless you change school/workplace so by propagating for "stop internet harassment" on the same level (often higher level and intensity) than irl harassment and bullying it makes me so fucking mad, i suffered through 9 years straight in 3 different schools of irl hardcore bullying so when i see these little shits whining about that they got ptsd from online harassment from stuff like mean fb comments i flip my shit basically its just so fucking dumb...
I agree. I see a lot of people saying they have severe anxiety all the time. Kinda pisses me off. They think just getting nervous a few times is anxiety. Then people don't believe the people who truly do have anxiety issues. When I took my CNA course my instructor almost took me to a hospital when I had an anxiety attack before big tests. She made me s e a doc and get meds  xD I totally agree with you on that one.
^I used to have severe anxiety about thunderstorms. On sundays my dad used to take me to the park and if there was even one cloud in the sky I refused to go and if I did go, I couldn't enjoy myself because I was just nervous about the weather. Once at a school picnic it was sunny but I still got so anxious that my teacher had to drive me back to the school so my mom could pick me up. Yeah...I'd never go back to that part of my life. Anxiety is definitely NOT cool/cute to have.
Find some other way to look interesting and cool, then.
^I don't make up my problems dude, I was professionally diagnosed with tourettes, ADHD, and anxiety
i see cassettes is as cancerous as ever
Actually, I'm referring to self diagnosis. It makes you look cool. If you oppose it so much, find an alternative.
Ever wondered what whale cum looks like?
^probably the same as humans'.
Derail warning
I'm bipolar, and I also have adhd and ocd. Three illnesses that kids are so quick to claim on tumblr. I never understood the aesthetic of being "fucked up" like, it kind of sucks????? It took me years to get officially diagnosed, it's far more complicated than googling your symptoms.
mmhm true shit and now people use it as a kind of badge of honor because it "sounds cool" i mean for us who suffer from these illnesses and have gone to the countless meetings done the many times realy weird tests and talked to several psychiatrists and gotten the paper to prove it finally its not something we chose to be just because, its something that just happened. nowadays people see it as an accesory and that is fucked up like they think they can just choose wich mental disorders to have.
^True. On another note, there's not really an age for having mental illness. I was 7 when I was diagnosed with tourettes and ADHD.
I feel man. I was ACTUALLY DOCTOR-diagnosed with PTSD, so it really pisses me off when people start wanting disorders and stuff.. It really urks me.

Okay so currently my sister is in the hospital because tonight she tried to take her life away by a bullet to her head. All because she was unloved and tricked. :'( Isabel was/is a very caring,hard working,sensitive person and she always helps people but never herself and she never disscusses her depression issues with anyone. Seeing my sister like that hurt so much to what no words can describe how I felt seeing her like that. But allow this to be a lesson to those responsible in this, suicide isnt a game and neither is my sister's life. Please dont try to lose your life just because of someone else.
Id honestly love to meet her one day
She should be back in two weeks as long as she starts to heal
Last night because this guy TheEndxXxX broke up with her and she told him if he ever did break up with her she'd kill herself because she loved him and she was accused of just being an attention seeker so she decided to prove she wasnt kidding
How do you know I'm not her friend? Just because a website says so, I still think you're full of it, Isabel. Suicide isn't funny. and No, You obviously don;t know how hospitals work. You should learn about how they work before you pretend to be in one. When you are admitted into a hospital you are under State care, You are under hospital care, Your parents sign you over to the hospital, Your parents sit in admission for hours, and sign paper after paper for a doctor to give you any medication, restrain you, And they are not responsible for you getting into fights, or you dying, or killing yourself or killing anybody else. But, BY LAW. You have rights in the hospital. But a phone call is a privilege . You get one phone call a day, maybe two. But the hospital can take that away from you. and you can only call family. or care takers. Try again, Isabel.
But isabel, I'm done now. No worries. Dont get nervous because im calling you out on your bullshit ,
No youre not my friend because if you were youd believe me but im better than to sit here and get upset over you being a bitch to me I dont care if you believe me only my true friends do and thats all that matters.
Um... A shot to the head is very difficult to survive. If she did shoot herself, she wouldn't be back in two weeks.
Suicide is horribly sad yet perfectly beautiful.
So much hate on here... We should all just chill and be friends.
More childish arguing...
My heart goes out to those affected by this tragedy.
i was in for the same thing last year i was in a mentle hospital for 6 days
I'm too dumb to even commit suicide :P

Anyone want to get fancy into religion? Feel free to discuss.I personally am a Christian.
Taoist
Christian
Catholic and partly Buddhist
Not a religon, obviously, but Atheism for me. It's an interesting mix on Emowire. :3
Christian here
Don't worry Kass, I still love you even though you are forced to be that. It means nothing to me :3 Oh, and as for myself I am Christian Atheist. I believe in the Christian was but I don't really believe in the Bible
Ways*
I wouldn't say I'm an Atheist, but I just don't believe in many things. Only in spirits, but I don't quite believe in religions.
Well I wasn't raised into Christianity, it's really hard to explain. I just have faith and believe. And usually for praying for the best for somebody, and being strong and having faith, the situation calms down. And I thank god verily. And yes, I have apologized for my sins. I have apologized a lot. I know I kinda sound weird but in all do honesty, by all means, I won't judge anyone for their religion :3 .
Athiest, i tolerate others religious beleifs, i dont mind what people beleive because its none of my buisness.
Catholic and Buddhist :3
I mean when it comes to Christianity, I dont really agree with some things that they teach or claim right.
Im more into Buddhism, basicaly because that there are so much more freedom and also their view to world.
Buddhist~
im suprised by the amount of christians here, its impressive of how many people are religiously diverse. it seems impressive and proves that emo is capable of so much
Religion on here is indeed diverse :D .
its a very hpapy thing to see, i hope poltics and opinions become more diverse and more nonconforming, it is a pleasure.
I don't really feel like I belong with any religious sect or group. It's pretty cool though, the human need to believe in something. I respect all religions as they're all quite interesting but I personally find it pointless. I take a particular liking to Nihilism but I am still nothing. just part of a collective species.
I'm Jewish (don't hate me :
I'm an ancient astronaut therosist :)
Athiest
A total atheist.
If you're a christian, don't feel insulted or anything but I've grown a dislike for the religion.
I still try to respect...But it's just hard at times.
^Same here. I know it's not all Christians, but I see Christianity as a hateful religion :/

Atheist here, but I respect what other people believe in
I was a JW until I was like 12, always hated it
I was raised in a christian home. It just wasn't for me. So i was in secret of Wicca for three years, but i turned agnostic.

I'm a pagan, but its amazing sseeing the acceptance and diversity on this site!
So myself and a few friends are seriously thinking about converting from Christianity to Jediism and become followers of the Church of Jedi. We all have very little free time but have decided that if one of us goes through with it that we all will and will make time for our pillars of training and become official, certified Jedi. And no this isn't a joke, I'm being 100% dead serious
How much have you researched about it ?And what's the reason for that ?The most Important question :Which belief is more rational ? Which one does your mind accept ??
Hey stone!,
Just thinking, why not just live by your own rules, I bet you already do do that, but why do we need to formally claim a religeon?
I Know you didn't ask me but I just wanted to post my own answer ...
TheDude said:
Why not just live by your own rules ?
TheDude said:
Tch tch tch. You do notneed any rules to follow for yourself. Not talking about community rules which affect others.
Nope. Punishment ain't justice. Justice should be improving society.  My actions do not affect others. Give me a valid example.
TheDude said:
Give me a valid example.
Influencing people? Don't wanna say it loud, but this point you make is stupid. That is the point. It is exploration of thoughts. To observe and think is human, to follow? Well even mules do that.

Nahh... You should paid because you need that money. Ideally your gaurd should pay because he failed his duty. I have worked with the army to build barricades against naxals. I don't want to punish, just helpnthose in need. Rapeists you say? My friend wasbraped. Want the convict to understand that what he did caused us pain and make him understand the right way
 No hate. If that needs brute force, or he just doesn't get the point? So be it
You're the first person I met who is so stuck... So stuck up.. So rigid. Don't know if it's good or bad. The world has no absolutes boy. If you believe in one
 You shall be disappointed.

Non-Religious o.o
I just believe that even if you aren't religious and don't believe in a God, that you should at least agree that the Bible's statements are great morales to live by. In other words the Bible really says most of the time that you should be grateful to be alive every day, you should treat others as they have treated you, and most of all you shouldn't live your life as an asshole because then after you die you will have to go on eternally knowing that no one remembers you fondly.
Only a few of the bible's statements are good morals to live by. The ones about women having to be subservient, and homosexuality being an abomination are utter bullshit.
I'm sort of a Gnostic Luciferian as well as a Unitarian Universalist. My great grandmother and my grandfather were/are Catholic, my mother is a Neo-Pagan, and my father is an atheist. To a degree I respected all of it but could never fully identify with an organized religion.
Wiccan, but I prefer the term neo pagan since I don't practice like a traditional wiccan.

Grew up a Christian my entire life... now that I realize I'm not, I'm in agony over the pointlessness of life.
If you have a religion, hang on to it.
All lives are pointless at first. You must give your own life purpose.
You just had the best dream ever (you dream every night) you lived the best week of your life! It was so great! Then you wake up and brush your teeth. You dont remember a thing. Nothing remains. Because no matter how a life goes it is only a dream. 

It really isn't healthy for the mind to have that kind of pessimistic mentality
Your probally right! But it doesent matter. You die, nothing else. So my state of mind is of no consequence, is it?
I'm not religious, but who says there's nothing after death? Nobody alive knows, you only find out when you die.
Why would there be? Do you have proof of anything, anything at all spiritual?
Your speculation, like the rest of everyone, is only formed by your wistfullness.
(Yo this is a debate, pls lets not get angry at eachother btw just in case u r :])
You don't have proof of there being nothing after death, I don't have proof of there being something. It's not debatable.
Hey.
Or mabey...
WE WON'T
Because there is nothing to know.
Are you denying that as a possibility?
(Sorry for shouting im chill just some low-key empathise)
With what we can know, the Brain releases massive amounts of DMT upon death, So you are in a dream that makes 10 minutes seem like 10, 20, or even 50 years. 

there are stories of people who even life entire lifes only to realize that they are in a dream an then wake up afterward.

So we clearly do experience SOMETHING that happens when We die. because when we die we will probably have a DMT trip, It depends really, There are some deaths that may completly smash the brain so you cant see such things, 

So you may see a DMT trip upon death, Or you may see nothing at all. And if you do experience a DMT trip, imagine how long it could be within the first several days of dying.
Thats pretty cool, I like that a lot, it still ends though.
Tell me why and how if you would.
I'll be spooning the person to death
I hope you mean with litteral spoons!
nope I meant by spooning with the person :3
No I wouldn't
you guys got issues xD
I've never understood hatred, it's a stupid emotion that's make you hurt yourself because you are mad at someone else ahaha xD. You should try to let go theses dark feelings of yours and think about more joyful things.
theses are similar feelings that end to the same result. I prefer focusing on my work, my hobbies and my interests. Than thinking about people I dislike, it make a whole lot of difference in life :3
I do honestly focus on hobbies most of the time. Only once in a blue moon like today do I think about these things.
well I never think about people I hate, I don't give them any place in my life. and when I would be about to think about them... well I wank a good time and that's all ahaha xD
I guess we all have different pass times haha
yeahh I guess we may have... be warned I could try to tempt you to the dark side x3
Honey, I AM the dark side xD
ohhhh.... have you ever danced with the devil under the pale moon light?
Well... let me think about the ways how I would do this. Suicide bombing, MK-19 grenade launcher maybe nuclear holocaust... so many ways to do something so fun :D
Yes. It's my line of work
Done it before, why not again.....
And if so, knives are my favorite, cutting the beautiful butterflies into the skin.....oh how wonderful they shall look when i am done carving them into a masterpiece!!
Torture is fun as well, skinning and wearing it as a coat is another option.
I'd only kill bad people like murders, rapists pedophiles, abusers, corrupt people ect. I'd kill people how the Assassins on Assassins Creed with a Hidden blade like what the Assassins wear to hide their hidden blades on that game.
It would be Justice for me because some people get away with horrible things and deserve to die. I'd do it by assassination.
Depends on the person, really.
Yes. I would kill someone. Because she screwed with my life so much. She even tried to kill me. How I would kill her you ask, First I'd use a sedative and drag her into the woods in the middle of no where. I'd wear gloves and have my body covered in plastic, including my shoes. When she woke up I'd have a sinister grin and tell her WHY I'm doing this to her. I'd take out a needle and sew her eyelids under her eyebros and to her cheek so she has to watch everything I do. Next, I'd shove knives in the edges of her skin, pinning her to something. Then I'd slowly made a few cuts along her neck, then take away the thing she loves the most, her hair. I'd burn it in front of her. Then, I's start to rip out her organs, keeping her alive before I dump kerosine oil on them and light them on fire as I watch her burn. When her body is fully burned, I'll toss my clothes into the flames and grind up her bones so that there is no evidence. (PLEASE DO NOT BE WORRIED THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS. THE GIRL MOVED TO AUSTRALIA)
How utterly beautiful, i am happy that there are others with such wonderful imaginations such as my own.
Me?
Of course. I find your description to be quite revitalizing. Thank you.
Tell me why and how if you would.
I'll be spooning the person to death
I hope you mean with litteral spoons!
nope I meant by spooning with the person :3
No I wouldn't
you guys got issues xD
I've never understood hatred, it's a stupid emotion that's make you hurt yourself because you are mad at someone else ahaha xD. You should try to let go theses dark feelings of yours and think about more joyful things.

If you want I can tell you who it is
I am open to know anything you wish me to.
I like that idea. Some of us have already grasped insanity and are merely waiting to finally snap.
Well I feel killing or wanting to kill is pointless. Live is too short for hatred... I have way more interesting way to spend my time
Many such as myself do not wish to bear hatred, some of us are born with it.....molded into beasts that lust for blood. It is choice for many of you, but for some there is no way to rid of this bloodlust.
I think hatred is stupid... it's basically an emotion that consist about hurting yourself because you hate someone else.
I have an advice for you, find an activity that help you to evacuate both your stress and frustations, Use it to release your anger. I swear it's gonna make you a new person

I do not think it's simple, I just think if you put the effort in it you can truly makes your life better. You are the sculptor of your own life
Perhaps, but one's life is also dependant on interactions with other people, and that in turn effects the outcome of one's mental landscape. Are you insinuating that i have not tried? That i dont care for anything? That i am another useless being hellbent on destruction for no reason? Perhaps you are correct in some cases, but i assure you i have tried, i spent much of my younger years in a mental hospital: trying. Is it not acceptable to be what i am? I tried many things, and yet nothing works, do you know why? It is because the thing you wish for me to change, is not meant to be changed. Who and what i am, they are not meant to be tampered with, as it has been altered through my past experience. So you cannot say that i havent tried. Who are you to know what i have and haven't done? Even still, i hate discussing myself, it makes me feel as though you look at this problem as a small matter. There are many who suffer just as i do, and my thought is: if i can survive it, so can they. We do not need to change who we are to suit your social agenda, we only need to fight these monsters within, and find acceptance in our own sorrows.
I agree with you Dylan, but I can never forget watching her scream in her sleep, struggling all around screaming to stop that he's hurting her, all the nightmares she suffered with over them because of everything they did to her. All the scars on her body she tried to hide from me because she couldn't forget what they did. Even as I type this I can't stop shaking. I have nightmares about it all, about watching her and not be able to help her or do anything... Her screams echo through my mind over and over because of them... Because of him, because of those few people she actually trusted who used it against her. I can never forget or give those guys...
I know what you mean, and it must be something horrible to bear with it, and I'm not talking about forgiving something horrible that has been done. I'm more talking about focusing your energy somewhere else on building something new and better
Dude... this discussion is fuckin' creepy man. O.o In the army, we did have to work on a mine-field in a major Naxal area. They'd keep attacking the villagers. So we had to lay down a mine-field. "practice for you" said the commander. Hated it man. Just the thought of killing someone is too scary for me. And the forest thing... and assassin thing man... you people need to calm the fuck down. Or watch a movie or smoke or fap. Anything would do, but kill the negativity man... it burns yee.
yeahhh xD finally someone with sense.... everyone feel anger, we just need to find a constructive way to expulse it from us, and if there's nothing constructive to work on.... wanking works wonder indeed
Totally dude. Like when totally pissed go do push ups or something. Or run!!!! Running's awsome too dude!
@BeautyWithinTheLifeless...
Do you believe in hypnosis? I do, very much indeed! It does help clear inner negativity. Try the s.t.e.m.s. process to reveal all your emotional stress. I'll forward it to you. it is a set of questions you need to ask yourself repeatedly untill you have an emotionla out break. Once that is done, go for this hypnosis for clearing sub-concious negativity vid on yourtube. It has a candle in its picture. Be sure to try it out.
Still you have yet to understand, but i shall not pester you any longer with my own problems. Yes, i have tried hypnosis therapy along with many other things, but as i said before, none of it works. It isnt emotional stress, it is the hatred i feel for myself as a form of barrier against.....things within me i dont think you would understand. They say it is wrong to be you, and yet they tell you that you are a monster when you take their advice. The only thing left for myself and others is resorting to masks, to false identities within the human mind. Society will never accept us for we are a sign of reality.
How old are you my friend?
Yes you should accept you as you are. You are perfect!!! No issues. The problem is when you do not. Love what you are.
To love being a bloodthirsty beast is unwise. If i accept him....then the death of myself and many others would be imminent.
I am whatever age you might believe me to be. Some say i am in my 30's, others say i am in my teens.
-_-
Gaze upon me with your eyes of disaproval, i dont mind, it is not as if i havent already faced judgment already. Act as though i am lying, i care not, the truth can purify oneself and condemn oneself to a hell in which i inhabit. So go ahead and judge me like all the rest. Your gaze will never reach me, and your words will die in my heart.
I do not like what i am, but i cannot change it either. Acceptance seems to be the obvious course of action. And yet with that, a door to a far darker place would open. Perhaps it is right for me to cross that line. Perhaps not. I do not try to stay stuck inside of my own problems, instead i try to stride forward. At times one must look back to see what has become of them, to question the path taken and further evaluate the situation. Perhaps i have gone too far. Perhaps not. Either way, i shall fade with the tide, and rise once again with the moon at my back.
You're so poetic... I'm just saying, you don't have to accept what you don't like. You can keep pushing yourself through anything that gets in your way and become what you truly want to be... The same goes for most things. I want to change the world because I can't stand it as it is today and I will change it for the better. There is a lot of work to be done on my part if I am to do this though... and there I go I was nearly onto another topic so I'm done now.
Bro you need to chill. xD
If you killed someone and you aren't the law or in the army why aren't you in prison?
I served my time in a mental hospital, because i was so young they felt it would be brutal to place me in juvenile detention. After i was released, i was assigned to a therapist, and a long story after that.
Well this was worth the read :)
Maybe yes, maybe no ;-;
yes i would kill someone if they commit certain acts wich is primarily rape and pedophilia
if a person commits one or both of these acts i see it as if they have forfeited their humanity i see them as mere animals and should be treated as a common snail pestering your garden.
True that^
well that puts things into a nice intelligently put perspective anodyne u realy have the talent of writing :) and while i do agree with ur post i must add that maaaany people such as myself has certain diagnoses that stops the brain from using moral in a subject such as if someone has done a thing such as rape or another horrible act of violence upon someone i care deeply about my brain turns of n i could without problems kill someone by curbstomping them, (im not psycho i have aspergers wich basically means i have extremely hard to feel empathy but it also means that i give unbiased response to things) for example i am a promoter of the deathpenalty when it comes to terror crimes and pedophilia some people (well most) thinks that i am a monster for saying that a man who rapes a child should get a bullet to the head, u see in my logical little world he the rapist should not get payed prisonstay on taxpayers money it costs waaay to much and they cant be rehabilitated therefore they will do it again and again so my logical non emotional brain says that the only solution is death a bullet costs about 2 dollars, its like when i signed up for the military here in sweden they shut me out because of "psychological instability" due to me having aspergers, adhd, bipolar disorder and extreme lack of empathy they basically made me sound like a total psycho in their "excuse" to not letting me serve in afghanistan for a 2 year stretch. i just wanted to protect people from isis n such but because of peoples view on my diagnoses im considered psychologically unfit for service, so in conclussion it depends on the guy or woman holding the gun, bat, pipe, or any other form of weapon and that guy who just bashed another guys brain in might have had a extremely good reason for it but since our society of today is totally based on moral standards the real psychos gets free empathy passes wich is total fucking idiocy
In all technicalities, that puts you in the minority position in this discussion. If you already have something inhibiting your ability to feel empathy, you can't answer question that's rooted in morality without a large bias. Our empathy and knowledge of society is what allows us to make important split second moral decisions. I don't disagree that there are plenty of extreme situations that could call for the death penalty. I think that population control is quite an important thing in all honesty. Our world is full of violent people, and although there is hope at rehabilitation (something that's shown really well in European prisons) I don't feel that everyone deserves that second chance. Hell, even if we don't have the death penalty in effect, the least we could do is chemical castration so that we can prevent people like that from moving the human race forward (or backward?). I don't agree with eugenics when it comes to "racial purity" and shit like that, but if we're talking about hard criminals and the legitimate mentally insane? I think it's absolutely something to consider.
I completely understand why the military wouldn't enlist you due to the mental diagnosis. Even if you as an individual are in control, there's too many chances of someone with the same slurry of disorders to make the wrong decision in a crisis situation due to the inhibition of empathy. Laws are problematic, because ideally we'd be able to take everything as a case by case basis, analysing every angle of the situation presented, but we can't. It would encroach on human rights, personal freedoms, and privacy. Due to this, they have to make umbrella laws that dictate what can and cannot be allowed. It could be very likely that someone with severe bipolar disorder and aspergers might act out violently when the situation doesn't call for it, and that's exactly why you weren't allowed in. With our current knowledge of the disorders and disabilities, it poses a lot of risks to give a gun to someone who is potentially unstable.I pass no judgment on people with mental disabilities so long as they can control themselves, so don't take my message as a direct attack on your character or something of the like, this is just a rant from my perspective.
i once again am baffeled by your ability to express yourself in words :) and no im not taking any offence i know that im not the best to ask about morally complicated choices since i put the good next to the bad for example if someone commits a horrible crime that does not kill such as rape or severe violence this in turn could lead to the victim in question to commit suicide or at the very least be mentally and psychologically damaged for all time wich in some ways is worse than death so if this guy who commits this crime gets a 3-6 years sentence for brutal violence or any other violence related crime and that is then considered "served his time" and "payed his debt to society" i strongly believe that the person responsible for inflicting such psychological and physical harm that will plague and haunt this victim for his or hers entire life should be put to death and not a prison sentence, i live in sweden our prisonsentences are jokes it has become such a moral controlled situation here that now there is no longer a question of "why did the rapist do it" now its the disgusting question towards the victim "did you make sufficient resistance and hold your legs closed" and that is the result of a society gone totally batshit crazy overboard with a empathy controlled legal system, and the empathy has come to such a disgusting degree that the most violent and disgusting of fellons gets separate wards where the rest of the inmates cant get to them just because of empathy that somehow we are supposed to feel for a guy who has raped a 11 year old girl to death (that actually happened here) and the papers wrote about it as if he was the victim, that is how much the empathy controls this country, sweden is a enourmous crisscross of different empathy guided rules and exceptions such as psychological,drug related,ethnicity,if the rape victim made totaly clear to not wanting to get raped etc etc the list goes on its a giant joke our legalsystem is upside down and no country should want to mimic our model of empathy driven madhouse system
I would, for any personal gain whatsoever. But i dont want to get into trouble and im super lazy to not do the planning involved in it.
Mabey i would feel bad afterwords...Mabey I'm unknowingly saying BS and i wouldent do it...
But ive done stupeder things for no reasons before, and never do I learn my lesson that it was not worth it.

Those who pose a signifigant threat to my safety will be dealt with.
And i absolutly agree with what Anodyne said. We are improving as a society, when thing get serious we are considerate and kind. when it comes to enetertainment, we know better, but we find amusement out of knowing its fictional, Anyways yeah, when shit like this really happens we react better than back then.
Do you Feel mankind will ever make it to space? what will it be like? what will the politics be like in space. Do you feel nations of today could one day be a spacefaring empire?

Someone once said that humanity will be safe from cataclysm once we expand upon the stars...
That, and It's the most humane solution to overpopulation.
Agreed.
That moment when you feel all alone.. And question what Ur worth is just to find out you're worthless! I don't actually have the balls to pull the trigger but I wish everyday that my heart would just stop beatin.
Personally, I dont think anyone, no matter who, can be worthless. How could you find your worth?
(I only question the worth of life itself:[) 

Hey guys! My name is Karla...I'm very lonely and would love to find someone to be the cookie to my cookie monster. I am a hopeless romantic and I want to find my forever (stupid I know). I have found my true love but I lost him...so yeah. I'm just a broken soul....
I wonder how many members live in carolina though...
[Thought you might appreciate a reply regardless of the content...Its probally awkward for people to reply; but it is probably more for you if no one does.]
I know it's stupid but I thought what the hell I'll give it a shot I mean you never know I'm not looking exactly right now for a girlfriend but if you are interested then maybe we could start talking and see where it leads I'm okay with an online long distance relationship I've had a couple before. Also It'd be nice if you were into anime to Lolx
You and like 80% of the people on here. You'll probably be with one of these kids by the end of the week xD
Heyyy I am looking as well and tbh I am sooo into Anime. It is litterally all I watch. I am open to talk to anyone at any point..soo hmu I guess lol
Just why

Emowire's new motto.
Jeez isn't this new xD
Hi just a single emo.
Lonely emo I'm really looking for a gf in USA pa I need connections with girls who are near me but are that emo.
hi
i just wanted to say a few things regarding subcultures, if you since an early age have been through shit (psychological,physical etc etc) and your young brittle mind gets put through shit that most adults never have to witness is it then strange that a person become somewhat different... you then can become introverted and have a negative outlook on life before it has even begun, and this is where shit gets interesting and where people starts the labeling...if a person have endured abuse and then turns into somewhat negative, dark, emotional etc etc being that is not strange at all its a normal response to an abnormal situation and in order for the mind of this individual to cope it endured and then released the locks and BAM now we have an emotionally damaged individual who will just because of abnormal and absurd shit gets labeled as an "emo" with all that it means. people have a need to relate to other people just lika any other pack animal, and poof now we have the "townies" (for example) a gang of people who have been through shit and got emotionally damaged during their childhood and that is a pretty strong bond to have i mean when i was like 12 my only friend then said that he lived with his mom and not both and i naturally just like the sky is blue thought and said "oh so he hit her huh" and he jsut stared at me and said "no are you stupid!?" so when i found other who had a shit childhood and i finally didnt have to feel weird i was so relieved adn felt like a part of something (i used to be a townie and i know all to well how it felt when i finally had people to relate to it was awesome more awesome than any antidepressant ever could make me feel infact i stopped with antidepressants while i hanged with them), i dont care what people who keeps puking the word "emofuck" think. they who do not understand the darker subcultures will never understand since they do not know or can comprehend how it was created under dark circumstances (im not trying to be all edgy or anything im just stating facts) and many bands who are considered emo also has dark pasts (are you who use emo as a slur seeing a pattern yet?) so in conclussion by using the word emo as a slur and laugh at it like its something funny you just prove that you have had a to happy life to know how it feels to be totally fucked in the head from an early age...
This is agreeable. I shall assist in the clarification, emo, by definition has no bearing on ones lifestyle. A simple subculture of people who choose to like and take part in emotional works. A common misconception is that all or most emos are cutters, highly incorrect. I myself am not emo, however i am a cutter, and i find it to be quite annoying when the two are grouped together when they themselves, have separate definitions and underlying circumstances. So thank you for beginning something i should have taken part in a time long ago.
So, the UK's left the EU. Was this a good idea or not?
They don't exist at all, the closest thing we have to a vampire are lawyers.
Of course witches exist. Werewolves, no. Vampires, maybe. I somewhat believe they do and call me stupid but my reason is that tales of vampires probably originated from some unfortunate occurences. Perhaps they didn't stay as hidden as they do now 800 years ago, and after some mishaps decided to stay in hiding.
witches exist (met one myself funny story actually) vampires exist just not in the way people might think (i have seen proof of vampirism but in the form of energy vampires) werewolves no they do not exist the thing that people in the middleages has described was most likely a direwolf they do not exist anymore though (although they could exist in places such as apalachia mountains or any other deep heavy forested area) and furthermore on the topic of witches the one i met she was a friends mother and when we walked through the door in to her kitchen she sat by the kitchen table drinking coffee when she saw me and my friend walking in and she said hi and asked me if i knew i had people with me, and i asked what she meant and she said (and remember this is the first time we met) she said yes you have 4 german soldiers following you around and there was no way she could have known that i collect old nazi germany artefacts, and she exlpained that my aura was grey and then she explained that she was a wiccan and i had read about them before so i was a little bit educated in it so we discussed it for a bit so yeah that was a bit awesome :)
And how do you know she wasn't just making all this up?
Maybe your friend told her about the collection or yours? Maybe it was just a guess?
i do not tell just anyone about my collection. i only tell a select few and do not allow anyone in the vicinity of the collection due to the "offensive" nature of it 

and so you mean she nailed the very specific comment german soldiers? its not something you just guessits very weird to just make up from nowhere, and i know that germans are haunting me since i even have video proof now (i have one more vid but my girlfriend has it and in that my cat is chasing the orbs)
I had a wiccan phase and I thought a spell to make me a vampire really worked. I thought I was a vampire for at least a month.
Let's see that one, then.
I'm referring to the video Gas mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPFZOZ1wfQ
I don't see anything.
Wait until nearly the end, little red dots of light fly across the screen
Nope, still don't see anything.
i am actually trying to get stir up something as we speak and im getting relevant intelligent answers when i ask questions and i even invited the ehtity to sit here besides me and watch youtube so i got the answer befriend through the emf based vocalized ghost voice thing i have and i also asked can you knock and said please and knocked on the wall just to show and then it knocked twice right next to me and im in a basement no neighbouring rooms. and since i stirred things up (wich allways happen i might add)i have gotten pounding headache and a bit well it almost feels like you wake up from a party and are dried out and dizzy and the room im currently in has dropped to so low that i must wear a jacket and hoodie (and here we had 35 degrees today) and im sitting here in a jacket and hoodie

That could very well be some dust.
they move in very different speeds and in very different ways 0:25 one white moves across the screen and 0:35 one moving a bit slower on a straight intelligent line from left to right close to the cam 0:43 you can see one in the middle of the screen just very fast dodging past the camera and 0:52 a fast small one tha materialises infront of the cabinet and moves up towards the right and just disapears close to the cabinet door to the right, you can even see how the one in 0:43 moving in a very intelligent way it moves extremely fast and turns 

the thing im refering to is a program you can use to pick up electromagnetic pulses wich means it can catch voices not audible by the naked ear and that program picks up on these inaudible voices and on the screen it comes up what the supposed voice said and if it is relevant and not gibberish it is considered unexplained and thus paranormal you can for example ask questions and point to pics as me and my gf did we pulled up pics of jesus and it said stigmata wich was very fucking specific and then we showed a pic of hitler and it said leader so yeah cassettes thats basically what it is
Hold up, a program that detects shit related to electromagnetic interference? Is there any extra hardware needed?
nope you just need a relatively new phone in the upper priceranges i use a windows phone (dont know if its just the expensive ones with more stuff in it but my w8 phone works as one) my w8 phone can when i install a emf program efectively use its ability to pick up electromagnetic evergies from taking something as basic as phonecalls and turns it into a emf device that can detect inaudible emf signatures and shows it in words on my screen so basically it detects voices in the same way phonecalls work and in order to test it you can do as i did and ask question and if you get relevant answers and responses it is likely it is a paranormal fluctuation
Yup, yup, it's probably bullshit.
ok your opinion

That could very well be some dust.
they move in very different speeds and in very different ways 0:25 one white moves across the screen and 0:35 one moving a bit slower on a straight intelligent line from left to right close to the cam 0:43 you can see one in the middle of the screen just very fast dodging past the camera and 0:52 a fast small one tha materialises infront of the cabinet and moves up towards the right and just disapears close to the cabinet door to the right, you can even see how the one in 0:43 moving in a very intelligent way it moves extremely fast and turns 

the thing im refering to is a program you can use to pick up electromagnetic pulses wich means it can catch voices not audible by the naked ear and that program picks up on these inaudible voices and on the screen it comes up what the supposed voice said and if it is relevant and not gibberish it is considered unexplained and thus paranormal you can for example ask questions and point to pics as me and my gf did we pulled up pics of jesus and it said stigmata wich was very fucking specific and then we showed a pic of hitler and it said leader so yeah cassettes thats basically what it is
Hold up, a program that detects shit related to electromagnetic interference? Is there any extra hardware needed?
nope you just need a relatively new phone in the upper priceranges i use a windows phone (dont know if its just the expensive ones with more stuff in it but my w8 phone works as one) my w8 phone can when i install a emf program efectively use its ability to pick up electromagnetic evergies from taking something as basic as phonecalls and turns it into a emf device that can detect inaudible emf signatures and shows it in words on my screen so basically it detects voices in the same way phonecalls work and in order to test it you can do as i did and ask question and if you get relevant answers and responses it is likely it is a paranormal fluctuation
Yup, yup, it's probably bullshit.
ok your opinion

The nazis have still existed regardless if the book is there or not. And what's so bad about Hitler when Stalin is 50x worse?
Mein Kampf shouldn't be censored -- it should be completely uncensored so we can understand history from the perspective of Hitler himself to its fullest.. History has already been written so there's no point in trying to censor non-fictional words that have had a played a giant role in terms of historical events.
I agree.

Got a point there, I think he means directly from Hitler however, The very source of the Public Perspective of Nazi Germany.
Well... No. Everyone was thinking this stuff, Hitler just put it into words. This perspective was around probably quite a while before Hitler even wrote Mein Kampf.
With Automation on the rise and Machines replacing jobs and serving as a means to more production and efficiency, Do you think we would shift from being souly a capitalist Society to becoming more of an Automated Society where a majority of Human work is Working on the machines, Scholars, And higher up jobs involving leadership, The jobs we want, and Ect.

I've used manic panic before, but used only one of their colors which was Vampire Red. I think it's really easy to use, but its fades quick.
Ok, and you just put it on, not mix it with peroxide?
No, don't mix with peroxide. It says it on the bottle/Jar too
Thanks! I recently got it dyed and the purple they used faded pretty quick after only two washes. And they did bleach my hair. It wasn't as light as I wanted it to be since I've had COLOR on top of color on top of color since none of the colors of done required bleaching since I couldn't have any 'crazy hair Colton' where I worked. But then when I started my new job in August and they said it was allowed. But I started with only a little 'crazy' color at first. And then went all out just recently. 
So when they bleaches my hair they had to do it twice to get it to be light enough for the purple to show. But still could've been lighter. 
So I'm thinking of buying just some purple and putting it in every once in a while. And maybe the blue that is underneath as well just to touch it up every once in a while instead of paying to get it done every few weeks since I'm not working anymore to focus on school.
I've been dyeing my hair since I was 7 (20 now xD)
I have always jumped back and forth between getting my hair done at a Salon or DIM with Manic Panic.
I recently switched to Splat when I learned a friend of mine never gets her done professionally and uses that product.
It comes with bleaching, the hair color and a comb. Though bleaching ones hair numerous times does do massive damage on ones hair.
Last year I got a chemical hair cut bleaching one to many and had to cut my hair boyish shoirt and let it grow out.
I live in Canada though and Splat/Manic Panic are the same price. If I'm not bleaching my hair. I'll go MP. If I am and I'm being careful/having someone do it for me. I'll go Splat.
I enjoyed it. I did the Red/Purple Splat. The red stayed for about one month even with my exessive washing every other day.
The purple faded extremely quick like within a week which I found unfortunately. I loved the vibrance 
Manic panic never worked for me. I have black hair so I needed a good bleach kit, (~$45) and then colour. Id bleach, wait a few days and colour, and a week later it was faded. I've tried green, blue, pink, red, and purple,before seeking another brand. 
I switched to Splat, which comes with bleach (for ~$15) and I had the colour stay vivid up to 3-4 months, (crimson red). 
Maybe MP wasn't compatible with me because I know others that it worked fine for others. 

One tip I can suggest for longer colour wear is to add a drop, maybe the size of a dimensional, to your shampoo. It refreshes the colour. Only downside about Splat, (not sure about MP) is the staining.
This is awesome but is the website reliable I mean it's not like a scam site or nothing rightand is the shipping reasonable? 
If so I might buy from them in the near future. :3
yeah it's more reliable that those wholesale site. just be warned the shipping might be a bit much.. but it is still reliable.
Thanks thats good to know and if the shipping is'ent to much I'll probably be shopping from them pretty soon. :3
Oh god I've been looking for something like this for so long! It's hard to find any pastel goth clothing in normal stores, and even then it's not usually what I'm looking for. Good resources are so rare ;n; thank you for this gift
No problem!!! D: i know the struggle. it's so frickin hard .
I've never heard of the terms pastel goth. lol. I'm getting old. But anyways, thats some cute stuff.
Hello! I'm Savannah! c: I am 14. Anyway, I also ask my mom, "Mom, if I pay for the makeup, can I start wearing black eyeshadow/eyeliner?" and my mom always says "No. I don't want you to be Goth." I never tell her that there are different styles. My grandparents think I'm becoming Goth just because I have teal in my hair. Can someone tell me if I'm too young to wear black eyeshadow/eyeliner? Or should I give my mom more time to think about the question? All comments will be appreciated!
It's hard to say if you're too 'young' to be wearing makeup as I believe everyone does things at their own pace, however.. here's an idea :)Maybe you can sit down and talk to your mom about makeup more. Quite possibly if you ask her to teach you different ways to apply the eyeshadow/eyeliner so it won't look too heavy or like too much to start off with, maybe she'll be more open to it :)
You're very welcome! I've been told that many times haha :)Well, a bit like the makeup thing, you may need to just sit and talk with her about it. Explain that since your hair is already partially teal, you'd really like to dye the rest of it. Maybe even go as far to explain how happy it'd make you to do so. Worst case scenerio, you could always dye your hair back to a more natural color so it shouldn't be too big of a deal :)
Thank you for helping me! :) Anyway, my grandparents think I'm Goth just because I got teal highlights about 4 months ago (which my mom let me have...) I don't mean to be rude...but how did you get your parents/guardian to let you dye your hair? I haven't talked to my mom about the makeup yet..but I'm going to wait until she's in a good mood. Anyway, uhm....my mom won't let me date...I mean..it's not like I am going to get pregnant or something...but..anyway...yeah. c: Wow...this has turned into a not-about-hair anymore topic! Haha... :) I hope you don't mind that I'm asking all these questions..and if you do..I'm so sorry and I won't bother you again.
You're welcome :) I don't mind you asking questions, I'm here to help!Well see.. I'm an adult, 20 and live on my own, I've lived on my own since I was 16.. so my mom has zero say in anything I do, nor does she even care xD so I was always able to do whatever I wanted, however.. being you are 14 & live under your mother's rules the best thing to do is just be respectful about the sitatuion and just explain all the reasons why you really want to do those things:) Sometimes parents automatically think the worst when it comes to things, so it's best to just talk it out & express the happiness it'll bring you..and just hope they understand :)
I gradually did it. I would go darker and darker each week and my mom finally just accepted it. I love makeup, and always have. And now I work as an independent presenter for a makeup company and sell makeup everyday! It is your face. Experiment and find what looks you like and perfect them, then those around you will accept and love your style because it's yours! 
I did the same thing as Shannon did. I just let it get darker and darker.
Although my profile picture isn't a good example, I'm not wearing make up in that one cx
Well if you're living with your parents, you can't do much other than sit down and talk to them calmly. My mom didn't like me wearing dark makeup, but after a while she agreed to let me wear it on weekends. As soon as I moved out, it was black eyeliner and bright red eye shadow every day.
I haven't gotten an emo haircut (layered with side bangs) since I was 13 and I wasn't even emo back then I just liked how it looked, and I really want to get another one this summer but I haven't found good reference images online. I'm growing my hair out and I want to get an emo style without decreasing the length. Any ideas?
Get dreads! ^_^
erm, I'm white, so that would be cultural apropriation.
I have dreads.... I'm white....
Lol I'm not sure what style I want out what color(s) so plz give suggestions.

It really doesn't matter.. Just look up some or a tutorial and go from there ^-^
I share the same opinion as the tiny one.
Makeup isn't for feeling confident, it's foor looking cool. Thick black eyeliner looks metal as fuck.
BulletForMySilentSuicide said: Makeup isn't for feeling confident, it's foor looking cool. Thick black eyeliner looks metal as fuck.
You just made my point further.
If you care that you look cool or how you look, then you might LACK CONFIDENCE in yourself of how you feel. 

You don't get my point. There are people who are very confident but still wear makeup, for example pink lipgloss, because they love the color pink. Plus, putting on makeup is fucking fun. I like my bare face, I don't wear makeup on a daily basis but I wear black eyeliner to concerts because it looks badass, and sometimes it's fun to just put on a bunch of makeup and look like a barbie.
Plus have you thought of people who wear it for their job? Like drag queens?
SteFno said:

Makeup Artists are also required to wear it when they work.Who's going to get their makeup done by someone who isn't wearing any?Even us Freelancers have to wear it to get jobsPlus, makeup is makeup.I like being able to change who I am when I feel like itSometimes, I'm me and that's greatOther times, I put it on and I'm more laid back and relaxed.And then, if I want to be gay AF and wear everything pink and act like Barbie.. Well, I can.

Hi guys ^^
Two days ago i lost my emo hair((((((
I hang out on party and some assh*les shaved me bald((
So i got a question, how i can look in emo style without emo hair?
Maybe i need some ballcap or hat?
Thanks)
Wow, those are a bunch of assh*les! I'm so sorry they did that! I'm not good with hair and stuff, so I sadly won't be much help, but, you could always wear a beanie or something, I guess. Sorry, I' m not good at this.

Oh and also you can go to the police to report this...In the US it's assault and battery. 

That's what you get for looking gay in Russia xD
^his profile says he lives in Arizona, which I hope is true cause all gay and/or alternative russians should consider immigration
Beanies are helpful for covering a head. Some cosplay/costume locations have beanies with sewn on black hair sticking out for decoration.
Up until the past six months or so, I'd been using Manic Panic for all my dyeing needs. The problem with living in British Columbia (Canada) is that Manic Panic isn't the most available on the market. You can find it, it's just not nearly as common in drug stores or alternative shops. My replacement to remedy this dilemma was to switch over to Punky Colour. I do like the way it takes to my hair, and it lasts roughly the same amount of time (maybe even a bit longer) than Manic Panic. My only slight problem with it is that it isn't completely vegan. I felt a bit better knowing I was supporting a brand adamantly against animal testing and chemical use in products.What are your go-to dyes for rainbow colours? Preferably ones that can be taken off the shelf, not a salon brand/one that must be ordered.
i used splat when i dyed my hair. it worked way better than manic panic for me. manic panic didn't last as long in my hair as splat did.
Same! I've used Splat and it's pretty good, but I reccomend you can go get it done by a proffesional instead.
If you're worried about it being tested on animals, ask them! Probably not anyway ^.^
Try the ION dye. the aquamarine is amazing. i never had much luck with the pink.
N Rage also has really really good dye. [:
i use the manic panic hair dye, crazy colours even ones that glow under UV light (black light) they are very pigmented and easy to use :)
I usually use splat. (The purple in my profile pic is splat)
Arctic fox is really good it like manic panic but I lwrsytbi k it's better and also it is vegan and not tested on animals

I feel like I want 2 where lipstick, should I?
If it's somerthing you want to do, go for itI personally wear lipstick quite a bit, in all different shades along with the rest of my makeup

If you want fashion then go to the store, go shooping and buy some clothes or some accessories and then paid for them and you will haveeither EMO clothes or EMO accessories.
Or just look up stores online
Well nobody is perfect just to let you know XD ;)
My accessories I used to have about 10 pireceings  I had one on my nose still do 4 on my lips 2 each side  I only have 2 now and 4 on my eye brows 2 on each side go with what I did it takes time for the skin to grow back YA...

hey everyone,i was wondering how you guys spike your hair(preferably using gel or something like it) i dont have access to the pressy thingy(can't remember the name off the top of my head) so i would like something i can do with gel or other hair product. thanks guys and girls :)
Um there are good gel products. I use my dads XD what you do is you get a little bit and rub it onto your hands a bit. I get sections of my hair, hold it between my hands with the gel on them and quickly and messily rub my hair between my hands. Not up and down, sideways, like you're rolling something. Sorry I'm not good at explaining :( just try it and see if it helps. I hope it does~
My hair is stubborn so I use hair glue, especially when I had my Mohawk. What I do is put some in my palms and then rub it together enough just to spread it out. Then make sure you get close to the root of the hair and pull the hair into water direction you want it. Support the bottom more than the top, or its more likely to just fall over limp. Hairspray if you need the need.
ok so im updating my wardrobe and its basically just a bunch of super old emo/scene clothes from the early 2000s like hottopic n shit so if u have any ud like to sell in a bundle or give away (id pay shipping!) message me on here and send me pics of the stuff ahhh ! also goth/cyber/raver stuff is super cool too! n if u have like any gloomy bear or invader zim stuff i might buy that from u thanx a lot!! 
My hair is a bit short, I'm growing out my pixie. I already have sweeping bangs, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a style i could grow my hair into and color ideas for dyeing it? Something that would be good for my face and skin tone? Any ideas are appreciated Xp Xp 

Shave the whole thing
DylanDylan said:

shaved hair is such a good underrated emo look, so is short hair
example


i think there's been a trend towards more expressive, longer, colorful, modified hair and makeup since the mid 2000s which is cool but i think that's sort of at the point where it's reversing. i dyed my hair in elementary and middle school when i was last really active in emo circles, and the younger emo kids at my high school tend to have dyed hair. but i never deliberately styled mine or did multicolors, extensions, clips etc. (little energy), and i don't see these kids doing that either. i've had natural hair for a while now, and i'm even considering getting some sort of Dykey-Butchy shortcut because i think that'll compliment my face better
^Personally, I think a cut like this looks great on almost anyone.
Such a familiar problem! I'm also very confused while thinking about changing my hairstyle :) at this time I have a great experience in this and can't stand from sharing with you guys some creative ideas even if this topic started long time time ago, suppose that this info will be useful for all forum members :)
Usually I search for interesting ideas on different sites for example last time I used a good article with beautiful photos I chose "blue pixie" the only difference is that my hair is much longer :) 

Yeah, I hear ya, it was mainly a phase for me, because I always had my long hair, now it's semi-short, I guess that medium length hair kinda style. I'll grow out the hair again, just not the eyeliner-phase again. :p
ha, do you bro. stay up and stay emo !!!
Haha ;D word bruh c:
Makeup is awesome on guys, but be careful on how you put it on :P
Hahaha :)
Make up on guys is amazing! I think it's hot personally, and a lot of others have the same opinion. Coming from a girl, guys should wear make up if they want to even though society may think lowly of it.
Yeah cx agreed, I mean I would, but I don't think I suit it anymore cx
completely support. but what about finger nail polish?
Nail polish is awesome too :) I'm a big fan of makeup :P
There is a forum post just on that I saw xD good look with the discussion!I use to do that via grade 9, fingerless gloves and made sure they were black fingernails :3
thanks bruh :)
I agree it doesn't matter what other people think if you like it go for it
I personally think eyeliner on guys is hot :3
Only a small percent of guys can pull it off. Personally, I dont particually like it. Except for special occasions. (like a show or concert or such)
I wear eyeliner sometimes not always and get lots of compliments but my parents hate when I do cx
I say do whatever makes you you and makes you happy ^u^Fuck the haters.
I think its adorable when guys actually do what they want with themselves, and not care what others think (so eyeliner counts!)
Guys that wear makeup? I think if they want to wear makeup then let them.... I aceept them... theres nothing wrong with a guy to wear makeup if they want
I definetly LOVE guys who wear eyeliner! *U*
i think its cute but its up to them because i personally think the sexyest thing a guy can do is be them selves and treat others with respect
I think makeup AND nail polish should be accepted on guys in the society as it is girls. It isn't 'gay' for a guy to wear makeup, have his ears pierced or have his nails painted AT ALL. (No offence to gays, I support them). I personally think guys look quite cool with their nails painted, eyeliner and both ears pierced. There is nothing wrong with it and any guy that likes makeup and nail polish has my full respect.

There is a forum post just on that I saw xD good look with the discussion!I use to do that via grade 9, fingerless gloves and made sure they were black fingernails :3
thanks bruh :)
I agree it doesn't matter what other people think if you like it go for it
I personally think eyeliner on guys is hot :3
Only a small percent of guys can pull it off. Personally, I dont particually like it. Except for special occasions. (like a show or concert or such)
I wear eyeliner sometimes not always and get lots of compliments but my parents hate when I do cx
I say do whatever makes you you and makes you happy ^u^Fuck the haters.
I think its adorable when guys actually do what they want with themselves, and not care what others think (so eyeliner counts!)
Guys that wear makeup? I think if they want to wear makeup then let them.... I aceept them... theres nothing wrong with a guy to wear makeup if they want
I definetly LOVE guys who wear eyeliner! *U*
i think its cute but its up to them because i personally think the sexyest thing a guy can do is be them selves and treat others with respect
I think makeup AND nail polish should be accepted on guys in the society as it is girls. It isn't 'gay' for a guy to wear makeup, have his ears pierced or have his nails painted AT ALL. (No offence to gays, I support them). I personally think guys look quite cool with their nails painted, eyeliner and both ears pierced. There is nothing wrong with it and any guy that likes makeup and nail polish has my full respect.
I think it looks great on most emo guys who r cute..
i think eyeliner on guys looks amazing :)
I think that eyeliner on some guys is really hot and sometimes it looks really bad but I have no problem with a guy if he wears it. It depends on how much you use and wear you use it (top or bottom of the eye) But I'm in a committed relationship with eyeliner and no one else can have my baby
I think guys that wear alot of eyeliner are cool, they are abble to share their style even though others might judge you. I call eyeliner on guys "Guyliner" Lol
I love it as long as they apply it correctly.
honestly love seeing dudes in all kinds of makeup
honestly hate seeing dudes
at all.
I love eyeliner and black nail polish on guys :')
i was just playin
idk i just distrust men and look down on dudes
boys can be cute and femme boys, sensitive boys are important and we should protect them if they express those sides of themselves
Do iiiit
I'll watch I'm still learning how to do make up I like yours
i need some ideas for looks to go for :o
Thanks :) yeah, i'd post a pic to help with the hair but i'm having technical difficulties so XP and yeah that helps a lot.
I love the 1 one
I love the first one the best
Okay maybe I will do the first one next month =)
cool I would like to see a pic after its done
Me too but It will take a while for me to get my new tablet beause it will cost more money than a hair dye but I'm tryinfg my very best to save up all my money and I will soon or later upload a photo of myself but it will maybe take months though
its ok
its ok
If you have some sort of poetry or lyrics, post them here and share :DRegardless if it's a deep metal song, or a depressing melody and backstory, maybe a swaggy rap song, even a very symbolic poetry,I'm bored and I want to see what you guys have in mindAnd you should probably tell people not to steal your ideas xDIf, that is, this post gets noticed ;-; . I have an act for it not getting noticed xD
I'm going to try my hand at free writing here

A kiss
Of dew
A blade 
Of grass
A heart
Of two
Shattered
Like glass
Pieces
Of Memories
Stories
Of tragedies
No stars
To cross
No truth
But loss
A kiss 
From you
A blade
Of steel
My heart
To you
This blade
I feel...

Sorry about the choppy alignment I'm on mobile and such anyways thanks for reading :)
Not finished yet could use some advice though


How to overcome depression


        My life is empty. Empty of love, action, family, and friends.
    Drowning in a river of emotions, pulling me out to a sea of isolation.
The cuts leak blood that increase the size of the sea
    The pills dissolve into the sea making it unable to sustain life.
    No fish and no birds, no plants left as far as the eyes can see.
But the pills don't help, the scars don't go away
       The scars are like an oil spill streaking through the water tpurple across my pale arms.
           A figure appears upon the horizon, a beautiful women with porcelain skin
She's perfect not thin

GETAWAY
the hooks are screwed to place, the nails hammered as hard as the walls can take.is the music pounding your ears?is it enough to cover the sounds?are the doors locked tonight, for the last time around.
ignorant child or ignorant parents?we're all ignorant to the pain we bring.it's not puberty, it's not a fucking phase.have they ever asked who owns the blades on the kitchen sink?
all you ever wanted was a hand to hold.a voice to hear, that isn't your own.not the voices in your head, nor the voices of the crowd.they don't know how it drives you mad when the silence gets too loud.
when the ropes are missing, when they start hearing tears.you take a step and forget all your fears.as each step you take determines your fate.and they rush to your room for all is at stake.but by the time, the last step, you make.you've always been dead inside, so it has always been,
too late.
Oh twilight-- As I try to rest,
Though I twist and turn,
You still mock and jest
And yet still Inside I burn
Riddles crash inside my mind
Silent screaming skies
What's thou I cannot find?
What heart knows but mind denies--
A love beats within my breast
With silent lips yet still I lay,
Coward's heart in my chest
Lest be troubled til comes day;
Oh love within my beaten heart--
Mend my soul with petals soft
Though are angel and art--
Dreams of you come oft
But fade like summers nights 
Wishful dreaming as it may be
Now beneath heaven's lights
I drift to dream; of you and me.
More to come, maybe.
Pretty kwel
Thank you!
No problem
I like the cats. Very pastel goth ish.
COOL :DD
Thank you.

awesome.
your work is fantastic
thanks :D realy appreciate it most see my work to "hardcore"
yeah well most are cunts.
i really like your work, you're not bad at drawing and sketching as a whole, i can see that. i like the way you've only used red when it's needed, it's not over the top and the lack of other colours really makes it pop.
i like the actuall drawings too, i think they're sick. keep it up
thanks! :D awesome to see that there is till people who hasnt subscribed to the bs that is todays mainstream nickiminaj 1direction and the other totally bland copypaste pop culture bullshit :D i usually get looks of "are you allright in the head?" realy nice to find people who appreciate my work :)
Wow, you're extremely tallented! Very impressive work. Even if people think it's morbid no one could deny that you have a lot of talent.
Thanks yeah they say kinda that but  allways add"but you shouldnt draw that its not healthy" but i draw best when im upset and angry or otherwise emotional :) and this is a couple of examples of what comes out on the paper ;)


Amazing stuff. You could get paid to draw album covers for death metal bands.
thanks! :D the most awesome compliment i have gotten ever! :D
JESUS CHRIST YOU'RE AN EDGY CUNT.
haha that trolls second acc banned xD
Yup.
made this now i got pretty satisfied with the result :)
That's not his second account banned, it's his fifth. The staff of this site can't figure out how to ban IP addresses.
thanks and yeah i noticed that 100% of all his crap was negative slandering and ripping on people in various ways, its pathetic that he has that little to do in his life that he can sit and make fake account after fake account he must be a very sad and pathetic individual
He's 13, he probably doesn't have much else to do.
It's pathetic that you waste time feeding trolls after they explicitly tell you they're taking the piss. 
Well are you a troll or a kid who gets off on being an asshole? Make up your mind, damn
Nah.

I'm new and I'm only ok at drawing what do u think
^posting your art would help us in deciding that
wow thats sooo good
thanks :)

made this tonight at 4 in the morning, my brain works sooo much better during the night :D

made this awhile ago and put it up in my neighbourhood because islamic crimes is a huge problem here...they got taken down in 2 days :(

made a new one tonight...or should i say morning its 4 in the mornign here now :p
haha this made my day xD
and the camp councelors are veeeery proffessional and just lovely huh ;)
Could I post something? And I like the one with the grim reaper and the city.
Yeah your more then welcome Nope :) art should be free to all!
just make sure you say in the description its your own, wouldn't want to take credit for your hard work :) 

I've changed my mind. I haven't a clue how to post pictures
Oh fairenough well if you change your mind, you can email me the pictures you want to post i don't mind.
ms kassidykillz :)
I would just say focus on your proportions, the way I learned it was to pick a part of your drawing to use as the measuring stick for the rest, try to pick something that could fit into the other parts equally
Thanks Kolvx sounds like good advice, are make sure I try that on the next one.
yeah i agree with kolvx and dont ever look at it as a whole so to speak, think of an anatomy doll (you know those everyone had in artclass) that is a very simple way actually to learn proportions and make it look natural :)
Emo couple!

Hey my bf and I are emo can I send a pic

Out of space the queen of the sun Shone brightly as soon as she gazed upon Igloo icy figure that was the prince of ice their eyes met and it was an instant attraction they tried for years and years to get close to each other but only to fail and for every time they tried to kiss the queen of the Sun would go out and the prince of ice would. Melt and when they finally realize that their love could not be the queen of the sun go inside the Sun to burn for all eternity and the prince of ice froze his self never to Breathe Again the only way they could live for all eternity

If you want to write something like that, for fuck's sake, learn to use some basic grammar first.

If you're so uncreative as to be unable to come up with some simple charcaters, you're almost certainly going to churn out some pretty shit stories.
Well thank you so much for your input ^-^

I'm thinking about making a new book on my wattpad.

How is that possible? 
If I do it, who wants to be in it?

avoid cassettes9 (etc he goes up 1 nr each acc)
he is a troll who gets of on pissing people of and thus as a bieffect also flood commentsections do not even respond or pay attention to anything he may say no matter how offensive dumb or in any other way provocative it may be
cheers ds
I knew he was a troll thanks
Dont touch fire! that shit'll burn you yo!
Why did you make 3 same topics ?
We all know that. You're only feeding him by posting this. Nice job.
and the only thing that a troll cant stand is silence so now that i know that he is a troll and i wasted alot of time on him i thought since i saw him attacking newcommers who do not know he is a troll to give them a headsup
That is thoughtful to think of newcomers like that C:

Kota Dear, It's Gr8. But I Just Want To Tell You This; The Jews & Christians Believe In The Same God Yes, But The Christians Believe That Just As The Story Goes, God Has Already Came. The Jews Believe He Hasn't Come. But He Will In The Future. That Is All.
Its Jesus and I know I messed that up
The Character Doesn't give a fuck so yeah
Oh and I took this on the lake in front of my old house this summer.
another pic I took this summer 

Hey! So Ice wanted to start a YouTube channel for a while, but I have no idea what I want to do on it, like. I'm okay with makeup, I'm kinda funny, and I'm a bit of a dork. Do you guys have any suggestions for what I should do? Also I'm new to the website !
Just do vlogs. You can talk about topics you think are interesting and know about, or things thAt you Don't know all that much about but have input on.
O...m...g... That blue skull and rose one is drop dead gorgeous. I love all of them but that one is just wow.
Yeah that one took forever i put in alot of time into doing it and making sure the colors were right. After doing it uploaded into my drawing tablet sofware and sharpend it . Should finished the others but never had the time to do it.
Damn, you're drawings are epic. Ever considered becoming a tattoo artist? Seriously looks like you have the talent for it. :3
Oh...G...A....W....D THIS IS EPIC!
Fucken mean. Love it
hi here is a set of tattoos i made on myself with a johnny irons machine and alla prima paint (the guy in gasmask and helmet was my first selfmade had to do it upside down so i am happy with the outcome i have outlined so you can see them better)
Them tattoos look so cool:)
thanks! :D appreciate it :3
your welcome:)
wow.. you made it yourself. you and those tattoos are cool!
Thanks never been called cool before haha :D  awesome that you likey haha :3
Not bad man :D You got some skills!
thanks i "train" on myself to get better but since i have been drawing since i knew what a pen was its just like holding a heavier pen with an engine :3 so its going pretty good :D
Same :) Why buy pig ears from the butcher when I've got a walking blank sheet right here? Hahaha ^_^
haha exactly what i said well i said "i rather buy some new gasmask or various tattoo equipment than buying the skin of a dead pig or synthetic skin" so my skin works fabulously and i have a suspisiously skyhigh pain threshold (it proves very interesting during more intimate activities haha ;D)
Fair play ^_^ Haha
I just said "well there will do" xD
haha yeah i kinda get some impulse some days/night where i could be sitting watching vikings and suddenly my adhd mind kicks in and tells me "hey wouldnt a badass tattoo be just awesome to make right now! " haha oh adhd u so silly and sometimes pretty annoying but mostly its nice :3
Thanks for posting this as many members are not familar with CSS :-)

Thanks this really helped a lot. :3

Gaaah thanks so much for this! It really helped ^-^
I am still so very confused, I guess I will have to figure it out
Thank you for trying to help new/frequent users. c;
Omg this helped me sooooooooooo much
I just used basic HTML. It worked for me. Rofl.
Where did the instant messaging feature go? Could you, the admins, possibly bring it back?
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
We have chat which is lame no one is ever on it
I have alot of requests but no way to accept them
but just ask him if you need help
I hope your problem have been solved.
If you're on mobile then go to the bottom of the page and select "Full Site" and wait for it to load and you'll see a red "Notification" tab, select it and then go to " View All Updates" and accept any friend request!
I keep trying to send messages to people and it won't work cause it says I'm not filling out the "Send to" section and I'm typing the person's username correctly am I doing the wrong way or do they have to be on the friend list first or something else?
Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
DamienAnderson said: Click on your friends profile, there should be a button under their profile pic tha says send message.
+Or in your inbox, click on Compose message then type the user name of the one you want to send message to and the rest is obvious !
But what if there isnt the''send message''thing under their profiles?
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
i have the same problem,but the''send message''thing isnt there.
mine keeps saying that i need to add a persons name i did that but it says that theirs no one of that name
i wrote a lot but w.e
I second all of this, especially chat. I'd love to have an instant messaging feature where you could have your own group chats, and even different (and maybe custom) chat rooms would be great.
just make emowire exactly like oldschool myspace hahahhaha thatd be the best
Add video chat too
I will personally delete the account and ban the account. Please send me screen shots of the conversation to me in private message.
How do I delete my account?
post pictures of penis getting punctured with needles
go into settings.
why delete?
Alright, so, everytime I got to hit "accept friend request", I get this text here. I know you can still visit people's profile,andaccept there, but it's a bit annoying. Especially when you have to accept a lot of requests at once. It's easier just to click the "accept" button, and continue on. Once again, I know I'm not the only person with this issue, since I think I've seen a few posts about it.
I don't get friend requests so I can't relate
It's a issue for example everyone I do believe. There's a lot of things that need fixed but just don't seem to get done. Kinda feels like they just don't care about the site much or fix ongoing bugs...
Thank you SuicideSheep for reporting the this bug to us. The problem has been fixed.
Thank you!
I would like a better chat room on here, with pannel and shit and room to private chat and stuff and shit
What does that have to do with this?
nothing :( I'm just asking stuff
Lmao that was hilarious
was to lazy to make a new thread so I just starting talking in this one
Lol the way she responded was gold
Problem fixed so topic closed guys :-)
Sounds great.
Something we have to reconsider. Maybe Soundcloud embedment or something in that sense

This is what happens everytime I try to view any profile, and from what I understand, I'm not the only one with the issue.
you need to click on Updates and that shows you the profile
^...no, updates only shows your notifications. She says she has visited other profiles and they all had nothing on them. 

Vampire is right click on "updates" and it will solve your problem not the updates that is in red when you get notif but the "updates" next to friends, albums and other shit.
Thank you for reporting. It's fixed now.
Thank you.
is there a way to tag people on here
No. This isn't facebook.
lol haha thought that too
Yeah we dont have that feature
okay thx ^^
Hello very sorry to bother you all but I have a quick question regarding Group membership requests. Is there any way possible the site could automatically delete, deleted members' membership requests? I have atleast 2 or 3 and its making it harder to get to approving others since its in the way and everytime I go to reject it to get rid of it I get an error code.
So I heard there was a store on here... How do I get there?
I wonder the same thing everyday... XD
i contacted Emowire & asked them.. hope for a reply soon enough
What up wabbit
No not me though
Are you gonna ask the Truth about this? I'm sure that he can help with this problem
It worked out after I shifted to firefox from Chromium.
I'm guessing that this is a little late, but Emowire glitches on everything except Firefox for me anymore. It used to work on all, but not anymore. Maybe that's what happened to yours?
Have you tried to block that member?
He can't view my profile page anymore so yes He was blocked earlier today right before I took a break from this site
Great...topic closed
This site should also be app for androids and iphones
Sorry but there is no roadmap for app. We are trying to make the site accessible by everyone and this site also have the mobile version of itself
How does the messaging work? Apparently I'm doing something wrong :\
You have to be friends with someone in order to send message
From what I remember, they're not allowed. She has multiple nude photos but I doubt they are her own pictures.
Have you tried to unfriend and block that person before posting in this forum?
Topic closed
I just updated my status only for the text to copy 4 times over, like really? Idk if anyone has experianced this apart from me. Anybody have a clue?
The chat feature is working properly. It's because people dont go to chatroom; most members still preffer private messaging of the site.
Ok, thanks Monster.
